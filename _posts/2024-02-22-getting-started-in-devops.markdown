## Understanding the Basics
As DevOps aims to bring development and operations teams together, it's important to have a solid understanding of both sides of the equation. A few key areas of focus are:
**Operating systems and networks.** Having a good grasp of operating systems like Linux and networking fundamentals provides the basis for understanding infrastructure and system configurations. 
**Incident response.** Being able to troubleshoot issues and respond to incidents efficiently is crucial. DevOps teams work to prevent incidents, but knowing how to handle problems when they arise is important.
**Code versioning and continuous integration**. Tools like Git and Jenkins are mainstays for tracking code changes and automating builds. Understanding version control and continuous integration concepts and practices is a must.
**Monitoring and alerting**. Implementing monitoring of systems and applications to detect anomalies or issues before they impact users. Statistics help determine what your monitoring systems may be **missing or omitting** that could flag potential problems.
### Take Online Courses and Read Books
If you're just getting started, online courses can help build core foundational knowledge efficiently. Look for beginner-friendly courses covering Linux, networking, programming concepts, revision control systems, monitoring, and more. Read introductory books on DevOps culture and practices in your spare time. Taking detailed notes helps reinforce key learnings. 
As your skills progress, aim to obtain professional certifications like Linux+, DevOps Engineer Professional, or Certified Kubernetes Administrator which demonstrate mastery of technical requirements to employers. Supplement formal learning with self-paced online courses tailored to your interests and goals.

## Gaining Hands-On Experience  
While coursework provides a baseline, real-world **hands-on experience implementing DevOps technologies and tools is invaluable**. A few approaches:
### Build DevOps Pipelines and Automate Tasks at Home 
Set up basic continuous integration pipelines using tools like Jenkins on a spare computer. Automate deployment to virtual servers configured with Vagrant or Docker. Contribute to open source projects using Git and practicing code reviews. Tackle small automation and configuration management projects on your own time.
### Participate in DevOps-Focused Hackathons and Competitions
Events like DevOps Dojo allow testing skills in simulated production environments with mentors providing feedback. Competitions around cloud, containers, automation promote learning-by-doing while networking with professionals. Document accomplishments on LinkedIn/GitHub to showcase growing expertise.
### Take On DevOps-Related Roles or Internships 
Consider helpdesk, system administration, or junior DevOps engineering roles for exposure to real technologies and workflows. Unpaid internships can open doors, too. Ask about shadowing DevOps engineers to observe their daily work. Build relationships that may lead to mentorship or recommendations.
### Contribute to Open Source DevOps Projects
Fork existing GitHub repos, add useful features, fix bugs, submit high-quality pull requests for code reviews to expand coding portfolio. Provide documentation, handle issues, and engage with developer communities to build an open source brand and network.
## Pursuing Certifications and Specializations
### Aim for the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate
This fundamental certification validates skills managing applications and systems on AWS. Its exam covers provisioning, security, networking, storage options, monitoring and incident response on the world's leading cloud platform. Passing demonstrates abilities valuable for any DevOps role. 
### Consider DevOps Engineer Professional or Red Hat Certified Specialist in Containerization and Kubernetes 
For those ready to prove deeper expertise, the DevOps Engineer Professional cert examines container orchestration, configuration management, continuous integration/delivery, observability, and code quality principles. The RHCSA in Containerization and Kubernetes verifies hands-on skills with containerization, orchestration and Kubernetes.
### Stay Up-to-Date with Continuous Learning 
The DevOps field evolves rapidly with new tools and techniques. Commit to spending a few hours each week learning through online content, conference sessions or certification prep. Re-certify periodically. Consider teaching and public speaking to reinforce your knowledge. Leadership roles in DevOps user groups promote community involvement and career advancement.
With dedication to building an ever-expanding skillset through varied learning approaches and real-world application, becoming a successful DevOps engineer is within reach for motivated individuals. Focus on constantly gaining new experiences and insights.
