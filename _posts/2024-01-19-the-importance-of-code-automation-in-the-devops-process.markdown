Automating processes is essential for DevOps teams to work efficiently and continuously deliver value. One of the most critical areas of automation is in the development code lifecycle. This long-form content will explore how code automation improves speed, quality and reliability across software development, deployment and operations.
## Streamlining Development with **Automated Testing** 
Code automation begins during development by streamlining testing. As developers write code, **automated unit testing** validates functionality and catches errors early. This prevents bugs from moving downstream and allows developers to focus on new features. Test code is also version controlled alongside application code for traceability. Testing is done rapidly after each code change via a continuous integration tool like Jenkins. When tests pass, code is declared ready for deployment. 
## Accelerating **Deployments with Configuration Management**
After testing, code must be deployed into environments like staging and production. Manual deployment is time-consuming and error-prone. Configuration management tools like **Chef, Puppet and Ansible** automate deployment through infrastructure-as-code. They use configuration files to define how applications and their dependencies should be configured on servers. With a single command, environments can be provisioned, applications installed and configured consistently. This accelerates delivery while preventing human errors.
## Increasing **Reliability through Monitoring Automation**  
Even with automated testing and deployment, issues will inevitably occur in production. Tools like Nagios, Datadog and Prometheus automate monitoring to detect problems quickly. They collect metrics, logs and alert on anomalies or failures. Integrating these with chat bots ensures the right teams are notified immediately. **Adaptive alerting** prevents notification fatigue by only alarming on significant deviations. Automated remediation plays playbooks to rollback or fix issues without human intervention. This results in higher system uptime and faster Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR).
## Streamlining **Infrastructure Changes with Infrastructure-as-Code**
Changes to underlying systems and networks are also prone to human mistakes. **Infrastructure-as-Code** defines infrastructure templates within version control using configuration files similar to code. Tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation and Pulumi allow infrastructure to be treated as reusable components and code. Teams can stand up identical preproduction environments on demand through automation. Changes can be tested prior to deployment, ensuring reliability. Teams save time otherwise spent manually configuring servers and networks.
## Reducing **Bugs through Continuous Integration/Delivery**  
Frequent, **automated code integration** reduces bugs by catching errors early in smaller batches. Jenkins and other CI tools validate code commits by automatically building, testing and assessing code quality on each check-in. Bugs are found during integration instead of later in the release cycle. If tests pass, code is automatically deployed to environments for testing. Small, incremental changes minimize risk versus infrequent, "big bang" deployments. Automated CD pipelines provide feedback to developers and catch issues before they impact customers.
## Democratizing **Deployment with Self-Service Environments**
Allowing developers autonomy speeds up development. Self-service environment tools like Spinnaker provide a automated interface for engineers to provision identical test environments on-demand. Developers can perform deployment simulations and experiments without operations involvement. Shared services standardize services across environments. This streamlines local development and accelerates the feedback cycle. Waiting for manual environment setup is eliminated, freeing up DevOps teams for higher-value work. 
## Conclusion
In summary, automating processes across the entire software development lifecycle with tools, infrastructure templates and continuous delivery pipelines has significant benefits for DevOps teams. It speeds up deployments and time-to-market. Errors from manual processes are eliminated in favor of repeatable automation. Self-service capabilities empower developers to work more independently. Overall system reliability is improved through metrics monitoring and alerting automations. Code automation is fundamental for DevOps teams to continuously deliver value at a rapid pace.
