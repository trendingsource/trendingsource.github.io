## Understanding the Underlying Architecture
Spring Boot follows a layered architecture approach with each layer communicating with the layers directly above and below it. There are four main layers in a typical Spring Boot application:
### The Presentation Layer
The presentation layer handles HTTP requests, converts JSON parameters to Java objects, and authenticates requests before passing them to the business layer. It consists of views, or the frontend portion of an application.

### The Business Logic Layer 
The business logic layer handles all core application logic and functionality. It contains service classes that utilize dependencies injected by the lower data access layer. Authorization and validation tasks also take place at this layer.
### The Persistence Layer
The persistence layer handles all data storage logic, mapping objects between the database and object formats. It connects to the database and performs CRUD operations accordingly. 
### The Database Layer
The lowest level database layer communicates directly with the underlying SQL database. It performs necessary create, read, update, and delete operations on tables and rows.
## Understanding the Overall Workflow
The typical flow of a Spring Boot application involves requests being routed through each layer sequentially:
### Request Handling and Routing 
When an HTTP request is received by the presentation layer, controllers map the request and route it to the appropriate service class. 
### Service Class Logic
Service classes focus solely on **application business logic**, leveraging any required dependencies. They return responses back to controllers.
### Database Integration
If needed, service classes interact with **JPA repositories** to retrieve, manipulate or persist data to the database through the persistence layer.
### Response Generation
Controllers receive the service response and render appropriate views to return to the original client request. **Data access is abstracted away.**
## Additional Configuration Capabilities
Spring Boot aims to minimize configuration through intelligent convention-based defaults. Additional customization is still possible through optional external configuration files. This allows for flexible adjustments without cluttering core code.
So in summary, Spring Boot chooses an opinionated yet flexible approach with many best practices built-in, making it easy to get started with production-grade Spring applications. Its layered architecture and workflow provide clear separation of concerns as well.
