### Early NFL Saw Weird Rules Result in Bizarre Scores
In the early years of the National Football League, rules were still being experimented with which sometimes led to strange scoring outcomes. One such occurrence was in **November 1923** when the **Akron Pros** defeated the **Buffalo All-Americans** by a score of **2-0**. Due to a fence in the end zone, if the ball hit the fence it resulted in a "ground rule safety" worth 2 points. Another low scoring affair came in **November 1926** as the **Kansas City Cowboys** shut out the **Buffalo Rangers 2-0** thanks to 2 points scored on a safety. These unusual ways of scoring only two points in a game were a result of the experimental rules in the NFL's formative years.

### Defensive Dominance Characterized the Late 1920s 
In **November 1928,** a defensive battle saw the **Frankford Yellow Jackets** edge the **Green Bay Packers 2-0**. Early NFL games sometimes had strange outcomes because the rules were still being fine tuned. Teams had to rely more on their defenses than high powered offenses. Field goals and safeties often determined the winner in low scoring matchups. Such was the case again in **September 1932** when the **Green Bay Packers** recorded their second career 2-0 victory, this time over their rivals the **Chicago Bears**.
### 1930s NFL Favored Stout Defenses Over Offensive Fireworks
The trend of defenses ruling the day continued into the 1930s. In **September 1938**, the **Chicago Bears** pitched another 2-0 shutout of the **Green Bay Packers** in their heated rivalry. Scoring was at a premium in the 1930s NFL, as teams found it difficult to put any points on the scoreboard. Field position battles and turnovers dominated games more than explosive offensive play. During this era one of the few recorded 0-8 scores occurred in **November 1926** when the **Pottsville Maroons** shut out the **Providence Steam Roller**. The Maroons scored on a rushing touchdown and safety for their unusual winning total of eight points in that game.
### Modern Era Sees a Rare Repeat of an Uncommon NFL Scoreline
After over 75 years, there was finally another occurrence of an NFL game ending with the rare 0-8 score. In **December 2007**, the **Cleveland Browns** blanked the **Buffalo Bills** 0-8 in horrible conditions at Cleveland Browns Stadium. An interesting sidenote was that the writer's son was born right after this unusual game ended. **Cleveland** managed field goals of **26, 21, and 24 yards** along with a **fourth quarter safety** to account for their 8 points and first 2-0 win since **1932** against the Packers. The abysmal weather made scoring almost impossible, resulting in the **first 0-8 final** in the modern NFL.
### Historic Defensive Matchups Featured Unusual Scoring 
Two other notable matchups with strange final scores involved ferocious defenses. In **September 1923**, the **Green Bay Packers** and **Chicago Bears** played to an unusual 0-0 tie in a game where neither team could get into the end zone. Field conditions hampered any chances of scoring. Then in **December 1989**, the **Seattle Seahawks** defeated the **Denver Broncos 13-7** in a contest where the Broncos scored their only points on a **101-yard interception return**. Stout defense dominated the day as scoring was at a premium in these memorable matchups.
### Unusual NFL Outcomes Driven by Weather, Rules, and Stout Defenses
Games ending with scores of 2-0 or 0-8 were exceedingly rare occurrences usually influenced by some combination of experimental rules, adverse weather, dominant defenses, and low-scoring conditions that made touchdowns hard to come by. Teams in the NFL's early years had to adapt to constantly evolving rules that sometimes led to odd scoring outcomes. While uncommon, these unusual final scores serve as a reminder of how challenging it was for offenses to find the end zone in different eras of pro football history. Weather emergencies and turnover-filled defensive showings periodically contributed to the strangeness as well.
### Legacy of Bizarre NFL Final Scores Lives on in Football Lore  
Even 80+ years later, the **1923** Akron Pros 2-0 victory remains the lowest scoring game in NFL history. Other final scores like **2007** Cleveland Browns 0-8 continue to intrigue historians and fans with their rarity. Games ending 2-0, 0-8, or some other strange margin emphasize how football has evolved over the decades. Modern NFL games almost never end with these strange results. However, the occasional reminders like the **2007** Bills-Browns matchup ensure the legacy of these bizarre final scores lives on in NFL lore. Defenses may no longer routinely dominate to such an extent. But the fun memories of these unusual football outcomes will continue to be reminisced for generations to come.
