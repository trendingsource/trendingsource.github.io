#### An Introduction like No Other
CodingNinjas and GeeksForGeeks were the top options for data structures and algorithms (DSA) courses available in Hindi. While CodingNinjas offered Hindi content, what initially drew me to GeeksForGeeks DSA was a friend's glowing review. He shared how the course helped him secure a job at Microsoft and praised instructor Sandeep Jain. Curious to experience this caliber of learning for myself, I selected GeeksForGeeks.

#### A Deeper Understanding Through Clear Explanations
I knew basic data structures when I started but felt unsure solving problems. The course transformed this. Sandeep's video lessons made even complex topics approachable. His code samples cemented each concept. Within 4 months, I gained confidence tackling most problems. Dynamic programming and trees especially intrigued me, with their **algorithmic problem solving applications**.
#### Quality Surpasses Quantity Over Time
Years ago, GeeksForGeeks had high-quality, topic-focused content. However, rapid growth led them to prioritize additions over standards. Now 600+ new pages lack substance. Problems are artificially expanded through trivial variations. While breadth attracts traffic, it dilutes the original learning experience. As one example, a single problem spawned six related but redundant questions. This shallow approach distracts from GeeksForGeeks' original depth.
#### A Memorable Learning Journey Rife with Insights  
Despite recent shortcomings, the course exposed me to new problem-solving disciplines. Sandeep's engaging teaching style sparked my interest in algorithms. While self-study continues, I'm grateful for the foundation laid. GeeksForGeeks shifted my perspective and boosted confidence and skills and remains an valuable starting point for any aspiring programmer. While the site evolves, its early impact on my learning and career path cannot be overstated.
#### Lingering Appreciation Amidst Changes
My experience highlights GeeksForGeeks' transition from focused learning resource to high-output content generator. The tradeoffs are understandable from a business lens yet dilute the heart of the program. For new learners, I suggest leveraging foundational material while critically assessing recent additions. To GeeksForGeeks, I hope refining quality regains precedence over quantity to restore their pioneering educational mission. Either way, they'll always hold a place as catalysts for my ongoing development.
