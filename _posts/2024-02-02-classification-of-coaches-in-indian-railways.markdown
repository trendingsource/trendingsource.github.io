## Indian Rail Railway Coaches
Indian Railways has different types of coaches to accommodate passengers based on their travel needs and budgets. Let's take a detailed look at each coach classification.
### AC First Class (1A)
**AC First Class coaches** have independent or lockable compartments that carry either 4 or 2 passengers. Designated as H1, H2, H3 and so on, these luxury coaches provide maximum privacy and comfort. However, due to high fares, full H class coaches are rarely seen except on certain premier trains.

### AC Two-Tier Sleeper (2A) 
Replacing the old non-AC First Class, **AC Two-Tier Sleeper coaches** have 6 berths per compartment - 4 in the main area and 2 on the side. Numbered A1, A2 and so on, these coaches offer a balance of privacy and affordability in the AC section.
### AC Three-Tier Sleeper (3A)
With the goal of making AC travel more affordable, Indian Railways introduced **AC Three-Tier Sleeper coaches**. Labeled B1, B2 and so on, each compartment has 8 berths - 6 in the main area and 2 on the side. This remains a popular option for many passengers.
### Composite AC Coaches
To serve different passenger segments, some trains operate with **composite AC coaches** that divide the coach into two classes. For example, HA coaches split the space equally between AC First Class and AC Two-Tier sections. The rare HB coaches divide into AC First Class and AC Three-Tier areas.
### Second Class Sleeper (SL)  
Non-AC **Second Class Sleeper coaches** have the same layout as 3A coaches but without air conditioning. Designated S1, S2 and so on, they provide basic traveling facilities at economical rates. 
### General Seating (GS)   
Labeled D1, D2 and so on, **General Seating coaches** are unreserved and non-AC. With either 90 or 100 seats arranged in a 3+2 format, these are the most affordable option.
### Chair Car Classes
Premium day trains operate sleek **Chair Car classes** for comfortable travel without berths. Executive Class (EC) has reclining seats in a 2+2 layout while Air Conditioned Chair Car (CC) seats are in a 3+2 formation.
