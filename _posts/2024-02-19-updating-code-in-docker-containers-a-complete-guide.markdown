Updating code within Docker containers can seem tricky at first, but with the right strategies it's very possible to do it smoothly. This comprehensive guide will cover best practices for updating code in Docker and avoiding common pitfalls.
### Focus on Immutability 
When using Docker, it's important to consider containers as **immutable infrastructure objects**. Instead of directly changing code inside running containers, the preferred approach is to rebuild containers from configuration files whenever an update is needed. This ensures any container can be replaced at a moment's notice.
While it may be tempting to ssh into running containers for debugging or updates, it's better in the long run to stick with immutable processes whenever possible. Make configurations and Dockerfiles the single source of truth so containers are entirely deterministic.

### Use Volume Mounts for Stateful Data
Sometimes containers need to persist data even during redeploys, like database files or log files. In these cases, use Docker **volume mounts** to map local filesystem paths into the container. Any change to files in the mount will be reflected in the container.
Volumes allow containing state changes without violating immutability principles. Database files or uploaded assets can change without rebuilding the image. Just bind mount the necessary paths and your data updates will still be there after a container refresh.
### Trigger Rebuilds with Code Changes
For development workflows, it's common to want containers to hot-reload on code changes without rebuilding the entire thing. Dockerfile **_VOLUME_** declarations allow bind mounting local code for this purpose. 
Any file system watcher like **Nodemon** or **PM2** can monitor for changes and trigger restarts. Combined with volumes, this provides an easy way to iterate on code changes without losing container state.
### Automate Container Updates
When ready to deploy updates, leverage configuration management tools like **Docker Compose** to rebuild images automatically based on Dockerfile changes. Compose projects declare exact desired states so a single **docker-compose up -d** ensures everything is using the latest code.
### Learn from Failures Safely
No process is foolproof, so design for failure. Version control your configuration files alongside code. Have rollback plans in case of issues and monitor container states to detect problems quickly. Above all, avoid manual changes - make containers fully automated and managed via code and configurations alone.
With these strategies, you can enjoy code iteration freedom with Docker's immutability and reliability. Confidently update code without compromising container stability or deployment processes.
### Summary
In summary, here are the key best practices for updating code in Docker containers:
### - Treat containers as immutable - rebuild from configs for updates 
### - Persist dynamic data outside containers with volumes 
### - Automate rebuilding images on code changes 
### - Leverage tools like Docker Compose for reproducible deployments
### - Rollback plans and version control configurations
### - Avoid direct shell access Updates - trigger via code/config changes alone
### - Monitor for failures and have redundant processes 
### - Focus on automation, reliability and safety over direct hands-on changes
By following these guidelines, you can evolve code rapidly within Docker while maintaining infrastructure stability and defense in depth. Immutable deployments allow focusing on functionality instead of fighting containers every step.
