Java is one of the most popular programming languages with a vast ecosystem. When a Java program is executed, it goes through multiple stages before running on a computer. This article explains in detail how a Java program is executed step-by-step.
### Compiling to Bytecode
The first step is compiling the Java source code files (.java files) into bytecode using the **Java compiler** also known as `javac`. The bytecode is platform-independent meaning it can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. Bytecode contains instructions for a abstract machine rather than a real machine. This enables Java programs to be portable across different operating systems.

### Interpreting Bytecode 
The next stage is interpretation of the bytecode by the JVM. Every JVM includes a **bytecode interpreter** that executes the instructions contained in the bytecode. The bytecode instructions are machine-readable but not executable directly on the underlying hardware. So the interpreter translates each bytecode instruction into the corresponding machine language instruction of the host CPU. This makes Java programs platform-independent as it can run identical bytecode on any machine with a JVM.
### Just-in-Time Compilation 
While interpretation is simple, it is slower than executing native machine code directly. To improve performance, modern JVMs employ an optimization technique called **Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation**. As the program runs, the JVM profiles the execution and detects "hot spots" or frequently executed sections of bytecode. It then compiles the hot spots to native machine code using a JIT compiler. The next time those sections are called, the already compiled native code is executed for faster performance. This allows Java programs to achieve near-native speeds while retaining portability.
### Garbage Collection
Another important component is automatic memory management via **garbage collection**. In Java, programmers don't need to manually allocate or free memory. Instead, the JVM periodically runs a "garbage collector" that automatically frees up memory from objects that are no longer being used. This greatly simplifies programming by eliminating bugs due to manual memory handling. The JVM chooses from among various garbage collection algorithms to best suit the application.
### Multithreading Support
For Thread** multithreading** support, the JVM understands and enforces Java's **thread-safe** memory model. It supports the concept of synchronized blocks, wait/notify, volatile variables etc to coordinate execution of multiple threads concurrently. This enables building responsive and scalable multithreaded applications in Java. The JVM scheduler intelligently schedules threads onto available OS threads/cores.
### Runtime Environment 
A complete JVM includes other core services beyond just execution like security managers, class loaders, native method interfaces etc. Together these components provide the Java **runtime environment** where programs can execute safely and program functions can be extensibly added via native code. The JVM further enables dynamic class loading so that libraries and extensions can be safely loaded at runtime.
### Optimizations and Advanced Features
Continuous improvements have enabled modern JVMs to achieve incredible performance. Techniques like **profile-guided optimization, escape analysis, biased locking** et al intelligently optimize code during runtime. JVMs also support latest Java language features and provide comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities via tools. All these optimizations and features combined together ensure a great developer experience while maintaining security, safety, and interoperability.
In summary, the JVM platform allows Java programs to run reliably across environments through this robust execution model involving bytecode interpretation, Just-in-Time compilation, garbage collection and other services. This article gave a detailed look at how Java code is executed step-by-step on modern JVMs.
