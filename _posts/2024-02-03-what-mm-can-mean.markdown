### The origins of MM
The use of MM as an abbreviation can trace its origins back to ancient Rome and their system of numerals. In Roman numerals, M represents 1000 and MM represents 2000 (1000 + 1000). So MM literally meant "two thousands". Over time this abbreviation evolved to take on different meanings depending on context and industry.

### MM in business and finance  
In business and finance, MM is almost universally understood to stand for **millions**. When you see "$100 MM" it means "$100 million". This usage derives from M originally representing 1000, so MM represented 1000 x 1000 which is 1 million. Even though the word "million" is written out less nowadays, MM has stuck around as the standard abbreviation.
### The history of mmBtu
One industry that still preserves the original Roman meaning of MM is **energy**. A commonly used unit of energy known as Btu stands for British Thermal Unit. However, one Btu is a very small amount so million Btus are more practical. Rather than write "million Btu" each time, the industry adopted the abbreviation **mmBtu** to represent "a thousand thousands Btu", where the lowercase mm refers directly back to the Roman numeral origin. Even Americans who now say "million" commonly use mmBtu in energy contexts.
### When MM means more than just millions  
While MM overwhelmingly means millions today, there are still some exceptions where the original Roman meaning persists. For example, **serial numbers** or **dates** written in Roman numerals may use MM to represent 2000 rather than millions. So a document from the year 2000 could be labeled MM or a product batch from that year coded MM000. Understanding the context is important to interpret abbreviated numbers and dates correctly.
### The shift from B to G in particle physics
One field that made a concerted effort to reduce confusion around numeric abbreviations was **particle physics**. Originally they used B as the standard abbreviation for billion, meaning 1 thousand million. However, in British English billion means 1 million million. To harmonize internationally, particle physicists now use G instead of B. So a particle with an energy of 1 **giga**electron-volt or 1 GeV is exactly the same as what used to be written 1 BeV (billion electron-volts). This small change helped avoid misinterpretations between disciplines using different conventions for B.
### Roman numerals still provide abbreviations  
Even in the modern world of Arabic numerals, the Romans continue to influence our shorthand for large numbers. Abbreviations like **MM** and **G** find ongoing usage thanks to the number systems devised by those innovative engineers of ancient Rome. Their numeric language of **M, C, X** and **I** still offers memorable, recognizable abbreviations hundreds of years later.
### MM: Context is key for interpretation
In summary, while **MM** is almost always understood to mean millions in financial contexts, understanding the broader history and different industry usages is important. The original Roman meaning of 2000 and some legacy applications mean MM does not have just one rigid interpretation. As with any abbreviation, considering the surrounding context provides necessary clues to precisely decode the intended value of MM in a given situation.
