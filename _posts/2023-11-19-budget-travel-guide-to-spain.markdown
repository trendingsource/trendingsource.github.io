### Planning Your Trip
When planning a trip to Spain on a budget, the first step is choosing your destinations wisely. Focus on smaller cities rather than big ones like Barcelona which tend to be more expensive. Some great lower-cost options include Burgos, Pamplona, and Logroño in northern Spain. Be strategic with your transportation as well - look into rideshares or buses rather than trains when possible. Make use of overnight trains to save on accommodation between destinations too. 
Be sure to research accommodation well in advance. Budget hostels with private rooms are perfect for solo travelers or couples and usually cost around €20-30 per night. For an even cheaper alternative, consider couchsurfing with locals to experience Spanish culture and hospitality firsthand. 
To save money on transportation within Spain, a Eurail pass is a solid option. Prices vary based on the number of travel days within a 2 month period, with 3-10 day passes generally providing good value. Make full use of your pass by traveling between cities rather than staying in one place too long.
