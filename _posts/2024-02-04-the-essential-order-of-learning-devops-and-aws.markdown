An optimally structured DevOps and AWS learning path is crucial for any aspiring professionals. However, many newcomers end up wasting time and resources by failing to follow the right sequence. This article outlines the recommended steps to efficiently acquire the necessary skills.
### Mastering the Core Concepts of DevOps    
DevOps is an established methodology that aims to foster collaboration between development and operations teams. **It is not dependent on any specific cloud service provider or tools**. The first priority should be gaining a solid understanding of DevOps principles like continuous integration, continuous delivery, automation etc. Only with this foundational knowledge can tools and services be properly evaluated and applied later on.

### Building Hands-on Experience with Key DevOps Tools
Once familiar with DevOps methodology, the next phase involves learning popular automation and orchestration tools. Tools like **Docker, Kubernetes, configuration management with Chef and Ansible, Jenkins for continuous integration** should be explored both theoretically and through practical implementation. Proficiency with source code management via Git is equally important at this stage. 
### Choosing AWS and Implementing Tools 
After sufficient training on DevOps practices and common tools, it's time to pick a cloud platform. AWS is highly recommended given its wide range of services and dominance in the market. Begin experimenting with deploying tools like Docker containers and orchestrating them on AWS using Kubernetes. Other best-matched services like EC2, S3, ECR, ECS etc. can now be discovered and tested as well.
### Developing Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation
With Infrastructure as Code (IaaC), infrastructure is defined and provisioned using code and templates rather than manual configuration. AWS CloudFormation enables developers to treat AWS resources as code through YAML/JSON templates. This DevOps-friendly practice can be learned by **creating basic templates to launch EC2 instances, connect security groups, set up load balancers and auto scaling**.
### Automating Server Provisioning with Ansible 
Ansible allows for simple yet flexible configuration management and automation. At this stage, one can practice automating repetitive tasks on AWS like **deploying code, configuring servers, installing packages through playbooks defined in YAML**. Things like creating EC2 instances from AMI templates, running configurations on them etc. can be coded with Ansible and tested on AWS. 
### Orchestrating Containers with EKS and Kubernetes
While Docker helps package applications into standardized containers, Kubernetes automates deploying and managing containerized workloads. With AWS EKS, Kubernetes operations can take place natively in the AWS cloud. Key concepts like **pods, deployments, services, namespaces** essential for container orchestration should now be grasped via hands-on projects. Developing containerized microservices and deploying them on EKS becomes an important benchmark.
### Implementing Continuous Integration Pipelines 
The next fundamental DevOps technique is continuous integration - automatically building, testing and validating code changes. AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild make CI/CD streamlined on AWS. At this stage, learners can develop **CI pipelines that trigger automated builds and tests on code commits to repositories hosted on services like CodeCommit, integrate deployments to ECS/EKS clusters**. Obtaining experience with CI/CD tools strengthens their DevOps skillset tremendously. 
### Setting Up Robust Monitoring with CloudWatch 
Monitoring performance and health of systems is as crucial as automating tasks in DevOps. AWS CloudWatch excels at collecting metrics, logs and setting alarms. Here, learners gain proficiency in **configuring CloudWatch to collect custom metrics from applications, creating dashboards and views, establishing alarms for anomalies, integrating with notification services like SNS**. Such monitoring capabilities are pivotal for maintaining reliability of systems managed through DevOps practices.
### Practicing Event-Driven Serverless Computing 
AWS Lambda serverless compute service handles deploying code without provisioning servers. It responses to events and triggers dynamically. At an advanced level, learners can start working with Lambda functions triggered on IoT sensors, S3 file uploads etc or build full serverless apps with services like API Gateway, DynamoDB using Lambda. This provides hands-on expertise in event-driven, lightweight coding on AWS infrastructure.
In summary, by diligently following this arranged learning path, aspiring DevOps engineers can lay a robust foundation of skills needed for working with AWS. It ensures they avoid common pitfalls of learning out of sequence by first comprehending methodologies before tools and cloud platforms.
