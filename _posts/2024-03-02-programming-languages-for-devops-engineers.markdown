## The Importance of Scripting Languages
Scripting languages play a crucial role for DevOps engineers as they are often needed to automate various tasks. It's always beneficial for DevOps engineers to familiarize themselves with at least one popular scripting language such as Python or Perl. Scripting languages come in handy when taking on DevOps responsibilities where automated solutions are required.
### Becoming Proficient in Bash and Python 
Two scripting languages that are widely used for automation in DevOps are Bash and Python. Bash is excellent for writing shell scripts to perform tasks like provisioning infrastructure and configuring systems. **Python** is also heavily relied upon due to its simplicity, extensive library support, and ability to integrate with various tools and frameworks. DevOps engineers should strive to develop strong programming abilities in Bash and Python.

## Understanding Operating System Commands  
In addition to scripting languages, DevOps engineers must have a firm grasp of common **Linux** and Unix commands since these will frequently be invoked within automation scripts. Commands for managing files, users, permissions, packages and more are indispensable. Taking the time to practice and learn Unix-style operating systems in-depth will pay major dividends.
## Handling Exceptions and Errors Effectively
No matter how well code is written and tested, failures can still occur when software is deployed to production environments at scale. As such, handling exceptions and errors properly is paramount for DevOps engineers. They need experience implementing robust error handling into their automated solutions to ensure issues can be identified, logged and resolved seamlessly without impacting services or users.
## Choosing the Right Languages for DevOps Tools
### Languages for Configuration Management
Configuration management tools allow infrastructure and applications to be provisioned and maintained in a defined state. **Ruby** is heavily used with the popular Chef configuration manager due to its Domain Specific Language (DSL). YAML is the standard format for writing Ansible playbooks and defining infrastructure as code.
### Programming Docker and Kubernetes 
When working with container-based platforms, DevOps engineers interact directly with Docker and Kubernetes using configuration files and APIs. Docker images are defined through Dockerfiles which can reference predefined scripts and binary files. Kubernetes requires YAML files to define control plane objects like pods, deployments and services. Public cloud **APIs** are also commonly accessed through languages like Python, Java, Go and JavaScript.
### Testing and Continuous Integration/Delivery
Most modern Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD) systems are developed in object-oriented languages like Java and APIs are exposed to integrate build servers into the DevOps toolkit. Common open source CI/CD tools include Jenkins, Bamboo, and TeamCity. Unit testing and validation **scripts** are typically written in dynamic languages such as Python due to their readability and code reuse capabilities.
## Conclusion
The programming languages used by DevOps engineers depend greatly on the specific tools, platforms and technologies adopted by their organization. However, there are several languages that universally provide strong foundations for DevOps responsibilities such as **Python, Ruby, Bash** and YAML. With proficiency in these languages combined with systems administration skills, DevOps engineers can automate, integrate and deliver sophisticated software releases at incredible speed and scale.
