This article will discuss the different types of code generators that are available online and help you determine which one fits your specific code generation needs. We will break this down into several parts to provide an in-depth overview of popular code generator options.
### Generating Java Classes from JSON 
If you need to work with JSON data in a Java application, one tool that can quickly generate the necessary model classes is jsonschema2pojo. This open source code generator takes a JSON schema or sample JSON file as input and produces a set of Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) that correspond to the structure and properties defined in the JSON. This allows developers to easily map JSON data to Java objects without having to manually write serialization/deserialization code. 
Some key benefits of using jsonschema2pojo include being able to generate getter and setter methods, constructors, implement serializable interfaces and more. It supports customization through a variety of configuration options and code generation rules. Using this tool can save development time by automating the repetitive and error-prone process of manually mapping between JSON and Java classes.

### Generating Code from UML Diagrams
Another common use case for code generation is when designing an application using the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Instead of manually implementing domain model classes and relationships defined in UML class and component diagrams, a code generator can do the repetitive tasks automatically. 
GenMyModel is an online code generation tool tailored for this purpose. It accepts UML diagrams in XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) format as input and outputs fully implemented classes in Java, C# or other languages based on the modeling elements and structure. This allows developers to focus on building application logic and behaviors rather than reinventing the wheel for basic class definitions.
While GenMyModel produces implementation skeletons from UML designs, some custom coding is still typically required to fully flesh out behavior. But it saves a significant amount of grunt work and reduces the chance of errors from manual translation and transcription of model elements to code.
### Fulfilling More Complex Specifications
For more complex automatic code generation needs beyond basic class or domain model scaffolding, the options available diminish considerably. Fully dynamic generation of production-ready code from natural language or simplified specifications is still an unsolved problem. 
Some code generation expert systems exist that can interpret sophisticated domain-specific languages to produce things like network protocols or database schemas. However, these specialized languages require non-trivial expertise to author. Translation from simplified freeform text remains a very challenging artificial intelligence task.
At the same time, a human programmer is still needed to implement key behaviors, interfaces and algorithms that cannot be directly inferred or generated automatically based on high-level descriptions alone. Pure artificial programming without any manual coding involvement is currently not feasible for real-world applications.
### Limitations of Current Approaches 
While tools like jsonschema2pojo and GenMyModel address common code generation scenarios, they still have limitations in scope and flexibility compared to manual coding. Automatically generated code tends to be less optimized, modular or idiomatic than what an experienced developer would write.
Significant recoding or refactoring is often needed to incorporate generated artifacts into a professional codebase. The generator output also provides little control over naming conventions, formatting styles or other coding preferences that vary between projects and teams. 
And changes to underlying models, schemas or specifications require regenerating large portions of code rather than targeted updates. So code generators work best for greenfield projects where stability over time is less critical.
In summary, current technology excels at specific types of repetitive code production but general and flexible natural language based programming remains elusive. The best approach depends on balancing project needs with generator capabilities and limitations.
### Choosing the Right Strategy
In choosing a code generation strategy, consider factors like your specific tasks, required outputs, integration requirements, and preferences around manual coding effort versus automated production.
For simple data mapping use cases, dedicated libraries like jsonschema2pojo are effective "out of the box" solutions. When designing structured systems with UML, model-based generators offer productivity benefits. 
But more bespoke needs may require compromising between hand coding and generation. And changesover time favor a balance of automationand manual work. Overall the best path combines generative techniques with human expertise to produce high quality, maintainable results.
With an understanding of capabilities and constraints, code generators can accelerate routine development processes. But their role remains complementary to, rather than replacement for, skilled human programming within the context of a holistic development methodology.
