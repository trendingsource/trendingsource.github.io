## The Extensions that Power Java in VS Code
With the **Microsoft Java Extension Pack**, developers have access to a robust set of tools for Java in VS Code. This extension bundle includes critical components like the **Language Support for Java** from Red Hat which provides Java language features and the **Debugger for Java** to debug applications. Other helpful extensions in the pack are the **Java Test Runner** to execute and debug tests, **Maven for Java** for build automation, and the **Java Dependency Viewer** to visualize dependencies.
### Maximizing Productivity with IntelliCode 
The **Visual Studio IntelliCode** extension leverages AI to be helpful, harmless, and honest. It analyzes code and provides intelligent recommendations to save time. For Java developers, IntelliCode can auto-import missing imports, suggest keywords to complete expressions, refactor code with a single click, and more. These types of AI-powered suggestions **minimize time spent on routine tasks so developers can focus on higher-level work**.

## Accessing Remote Systems from Your Local Workspace 
One of VS Code's standout features is the ability to use it over SSH. This allows editing code directly on remote machines like Linux servers without having to clone repos or set up a full IDE remotely. The seamless experience makes developing and debugging as if the code is local, while leverage remote infrastructure. 
### Gaining Flexibility with Cross-Platform Capabilities
Many Java teams have a mix of Windows and Linux environments. VS Code's cross-platform capabilities let developers be productive regardless of their individual setups. Its **lightweight, electron-based architecture runs natively on Windows, MacOS, and Linux**, eliminating barriers between environments. Using it over SSH, developers can code **on Windows but access remote Linux servers transparently**. This kind of flexibility strengthens agile and remote workflows. 
## Streamlining Development with Integrated Tools
Beyond just code editing, VS Code aims to be a full-featured IDE. The Java Extension Pack brings in features like Maven and debugging, but there are many other tools that integrate smoothly.
### Enhancing Workflow with Terminal Tools
For compiling, building, and running Java applications, commands like javac, java, and Maven are indispensable. VS Code offers a robust integrated terminal for issuing these commands. Developers can quickly compile and test code without ever leaving the editor.
### Visualizing Changes with Git Integration  
The Git integration provides insights into source control without leaving the IDE. Features like viewing the changed/added/removed lines in a diff and checking a file's commit history aid collaboration and code reviews. Developers can also clone, pull, commit, push and manage branches directly from VS Code.
## Evaluating VS Code Against Established Java IDEs
While VS Code gave some developers initial challenges, has it matured enough to be a primary Java IDE? Let's consider it against alternatives.
### Comparing to Eclipse  
Eclipse is the most popular open source Java IDE but has a heavier footprint. Some find its interface unintuitive after years of improvements. VS Code adopts a more streamlined and customizable model at a smaller size. Its extensions also attempt to match Eclipse's full-featured capabilities.
### Stacked Against IntelliJ IDEA
IntelliJ IDEA is praised for its refactoring and code navigation abilities out of the box. However, its proprietary license deters some. VS Code aims to approximate IntelliJ's powerful tools through extensions while retaining an open source advantage. Its simpler model also appeals to developers comfortable with other editors.
## Real-World Experiences Developing Java in VS Code
Hearing how others use the editor hands-on provides the best perspective. Let's learn from some developers working with Java in VS Code.
### Leveraging VS Code Remotely 
One developer discussed productively editing Java code on Linux VMs directly from their Windows machine using VS Code's remote development features. This allowed consistency across environments without sacrificing their preferred desktop OS.
### Appreciating its Portability and Customization
Another shared how VS Code's cross-platform capabilities aid their team with varied workstation setups. They also value customizing keybindings, themes and setting preferences to seamlessly fit their workflows. 
### Taking a Hybrid Approach
Some prefer using VS Code as a code editor alongside command line build tools rather than relying on bundled IDE features. This provides flexibility while maintaining performance and simplicity.
## In Summary: A Maturing IDE Option for Java
Since its early days, VS Code has rapidly advanced through community extensions to become a robust and customizable environment for Java development. While it still has room to match all of Eclipse or IntelliJ's functionality out of the box, its extensibility and lightweight design have won many developers over. With ongoing improvements, VS Code proves itself a serious option for Java workflows, especially when portability or open source matter most. Its rapidly growing ecosystem of extensions also continues strengthening it as an IDE.
