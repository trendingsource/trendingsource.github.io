### Ensuring the Correct Source is Being Used
As the two pieces of content suggest, switching a TV to its 4K mode could potentially cause a washed out or desaturated picture if the correct video source is not being used. Most modern 4K TVs are capable of displaying content at higher color standards than traditional HD TVs. However, without a true 4K signal from a compatible source device, the TV may attempt to improperly scale non-4K video to its larger display area and **high dynamic range** capabilities. 
Rather than relying on internal upscaling, it is always best to match the TV's video format to the actual capabilities of the content source. For optimal picture quality, users should verify they are playing **4K Ultra High Definition** video formats, like 4K Blu-ray, from a compatible external 4K player or streamer connected through an **HDMI 2.0/2.1 cable.** Internal apps may also output 4K signals if the content is available at that resolution. But lower quality streams or non-4K disc playback risks undesirable color and detail issues.

### Understanding Display Color Spaces and Gamuts
As the first content piece touches on, another potential cause is a mismatch between the color gamut or color space of the display and source signal. Modern 4K HDR TVs support wider **Rec.2020 color gamuts** compared to traditional HD/SDR TVs which use **Rec.709.** Without proper metadata signaling the correct parameters, a non-HDR input could be improperly mapped to the larger 4K display resulting in washed out hues and saturations. 
Many TVs include settings to manually control how non-HDR sources are handled. Options like "expand gamut" may force a wider color space mismatch, and should only be used with properly tagged HDR content. For non-HDR formats, leaving the TV in its "native" or "auto" color mode is generally best to avoid unwanted alterations of hues and brightness levels. Carefully matching display and source color profiles ensures accurate, as-intended picture reproduction.
### Adjusting Video Processing Modes and Settings
A third possibility brought up is differences in internal video processing between the TV's various input modes. 4K/HDR modes often enable additional video processing features within the TV aimed at optimizing images for high-end displays. However, for non-4K/HDR sources, some of these extra video algorithms could potentially introduce unwanted changes to image parameters.
Many advanced TVs include specific "options" or "picture mode" settings for different content types that help avoid this. Modes labelled for "PC/Game", "standard" or even "film" may process video with less contrast/sharpness adjustments better suited to animated content or lower quality signals. Experimenting with alternate picture presets, turning off unnecessary "reality creation" processing, or even using a dedicated "game console" HDMI input designed for lower lag can help troubleshoot incompatible source/display combos. 
Overall, switching a 4K TV out of its native 4K/HDR mode when non-compatible content is played back helps prevent potential color, contrast or detail issues. Ensuring proper matching of resolution, HDR metadata, color gamuts and optimized internal video processing settings between the TV and each individual source is key.
### Double Checking Source Resolution and Compatibility
To really pinpoint potential causes, it's important to verify the actual output capabilities of the specific source devices in use. As the second content piece advises, playing true 4K content from a compatible **4K Ultra HD Blu-ray player** directly into an HDMI input designed for higher bandwidth signals usually avoids issues. 
However, streaming devices, cable/satellite boxes, older game consoles and even some internal smart TV apps may only output at HD or lower resolutions, even if connected to a 4K TV. Check manufacturer specs or use a resolution information display to confirm output resolution for every component in the chain. Mismatching a non-4K source to the 4K input could trigger unwanted processing.
Swapping cables, switching to alternate HDMI ports that may be limited to lower resolutions, or even physically selecting lower resolution output options in some device's menus may help determine compatibility issues between specific display and sources. Proper resolution matching across all connected equipment avoids inconsistent color/quality between inputs.
### Adjusting HD/SDR Picture Settings for Accurate Reproduction 
For traditional HD/SDR sources best displayed using the TV's HD/SDR modes, careful calibration of basic picture settings can also help optimize image quality free from unwanted alterations. Options like backlight, contrast, sharpness, color temperature and gamma should be adjusted using built-in calibration tools, external test patterns or recommended "out-of-box" preset settings from reviews.
This ensures accurate tonal and color reproduction for each input as intended by content creators, rather than overblown defaults. Many modern TVs also include basic HDR to SDR tone mapping features that can help extend the benefits of the display's deeper blacks and wider colors to standard dynamic range content as well within reason. With proper setting adjustments, clear pictures can still be achievable from any input without relying on riskier "expand" features.
### Addressing Compatibility through Testing and Knowledge
In summary, determining the root cause of washed out or incompatible pictures between a 4K TV's different input modes requires testing each source individually and verifying resolution/HDR support specifications. Armed with knowledge of color gamuts, optimal settings and avoiding unsuitable processing, users can address mismatches and ensure their TV delivers consistent, accurate images from any program. Taking time to optimize each input type leads to an enhanced entertainment experience.
