React developers have different options for declaring variables - `var`, `let`, and `const`. While all are valid, this guide will explore which is generally recommended and why. 
### Scoping and Predictability
One key difference between these variables is how their scope, or accessibility, is defined. `var` is function-scoped, meaning it can be accessed from anywhere within that function. But `let` and `const` are **block-scoped**, allowing access only within the nearest set of curly braces `{ }`.
Block scoping promotes more predictable code behavior. Variables are restricted to well-defined blocks, avoiding unintended interactions across scopes. Because `let` and `const` respect blocks, they reduce the possibility of bugs occurring from variable references in unexpected contexts.

### Avoiding Hoisting Issues 
Another subtlety is variable hoisting. `var` declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope, meaning variables can technically be accessed before their declaration line. 
In contrast, `let` and `const` are also hoisted but not initialized until their declaration point. Trying to access them beforehand causes a reference error - a more predictable failure case than unexpected variable values. Hoisting quirks with `var` have led to bugs, so `let` and `const` are safer in this regard.
### Indicating Mutability
The `const` keyword helps communicate whether a value should remain constant or not. Declaring variables with `const` expresses the intent that they should not change, making code easier to reason about.
Within React components in particular, values like props and states typically should remain constant. Using `const` for these variables signals clearly to readers that the values won't mutate unexpectedly over time.
### Compatibility and Modern Practices
While `var` works nearly everywhere, `let` and `const` have superior characteristics that most modern code favors. They align with evolving best practices to write clean, maintainable JavaScript.
React also generally encourages writing components as small, pure functions where possible. The block scoping and other traits of `let` and `const` directly support writing components in this functional style. Futureproofing code with modern constructs like these can avoid subtle bugs down the road.
### Recommended Usage in React
So in summary, React developers are encouraged to use `const` by default, reserving `let` for variable cases that truly need mutation. Relying primarily on `const` conveys intent clearly and prevents accidental value changes.
For component declarations, `const` is almost always appropriate since component instances shouldn't change. States and props within components also should normally be `const` since their values are controlled externally.
Following these guidelines leads to React code that is clean, predictable, and compatible with evolving JavaScript standards. While `var` may work, `let` and `const` generally produce safer, more maintainable applications.
### Additional Considerations
There are a few additional minor points to consider when choosing variables in React:
**Performance** - `const` may allow for optimization since the variable value can never change. The runtime engine has freedom to optimize caching or other optimizations that wouldn't apply to mutable variables. This micro-optimization rarely impacts real code though.
**Names** - `let` and `const` have block scope, so short or poorly chosen names are less of a concern since they won't conflict with names in parent scopes. But long descriptive names are still preferable for readability. 
**Nested Scopes** - With deep nesting, `let` and `const` avoid issues with unintended collisions in narrow nested scopes that `var` may cause due to lack of block scoping. The narrower scope is safer.
In summary, React best practices recommend using `const` by default and reserving `let` for truly mutable cases. This enhances code readability, maintainability and safety through aligned use of modern JavaScript scoping rules and block-level semantics. Following these guidelines produces clean, robust React applications.
