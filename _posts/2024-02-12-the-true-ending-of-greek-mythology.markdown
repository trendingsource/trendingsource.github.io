### The Birth of Ares
Ares was born as the god of war, the violent son of Zeus and Hera. As he grew in power, **chaos and destruction** began to spread. Ares claimed dominion over the war-torn region of Thrace and amassed an army consisting of his **loyal lieutenants Fear, Violence, Unrest**, and the twins Enyo and Eris.

### The Rise of Fear
Of Ares' followers, Fear (Phobos) proved the most formidable. Wherever Phobos went, **panic and mayhem** soon followed. He drove the people of mainland Greece into a frenzied state of terror. Even mighty Olympus trembled at his approach. Under Fear's influence, Ares' forces grew too strong for the other gods to contain.
### The Fall of Olympus
In a cataclysmic battle, Ares defeated the Olympians and conquered their heavenly realm. Zeus barely held onto his throne as the new lord of the gods looked poised to seize total control. Peace seemed lost as **war and anarchy** threatened to consume the world of men and immortals alike.
### Zeus' Ultimatum
In a desperate move to save his dominion, Zeus proposed a truce with Ares. He would relinquish the gods' power over humanity if Ares agreed to cease his campaign of violence. Facing annihilation, Zeus had no choice but to accept Ares' terms of **complete non-interference**. He sealed the passage between Olympus and Earth, cuts the gods' influence.
### The Fading of Faith  
With the Olympians exiled to the heavens, believers in the old ways dwindled without divine signs. **Polytheism disappeared** as people turned to new spiritual philosophies. The myths lived on, though told with less conviction as generations forgot their significance. In time, even the bards could not recall the gods' glorious deeds and ancient names faded into stories.
### The Evolution of Belief
Yet traces of the past endured in everyday customs and figureheads. Athena was reborn as the Virgin Mary. Poseidon's trident re-emerged in the hands of sailors' saint Nicholas. Immortals like Helios and Dionysus found new life through analogous human heroes. Though reinvented, the essence of the divine carried on, ensuring mythology's rebirth in unexpected forms.
### The True Fate of the Gods 
While the collapse of direct worship supposedly ended their reign, a new interpretation suggests the Olympians merely changed with the evolving human spirit. The eternal spirits live on, adapted to each era, reincarnating in our stories, traditions and deepest beliefs. Rather than perish, the gods transformed as required to remain close to their creation. In truth, **Greek mythology never diedâ€”it simply found new vessels to inhabit across the ages.**
