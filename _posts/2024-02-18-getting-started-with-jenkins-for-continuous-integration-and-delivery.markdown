Jenkins is an open source automation server that enables developers around the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software. This guide will explain how to get started with Jenkins for your continuous integration and delivery needs.
## Understanding Continuous Integration and Delivery Fundamentals
Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. If the build fails, developers can identify the cause quickly and fix it. 
Continuous delivery (CD) takes CI further by making sure codeVerified by automated testing is kept in a deployable state at all times. Changes can potentially be deployed automatically or manually. This enables faster delivery of code changes and more frequent software releases with higher quality and lower risk. 
### Continuous Integration Benefits
There are several key **benefits** of implementing continuous integration:
- **Improvedcode quality** - Issues are detected sooner through frequent automated testing and builds. Fixing problems is easier when changes are smaller. 
- **Earlier feedback** - Developers get fast feedback on code quality through automated testing. This reduces time spent on debugging and troubleshooting. 
- **Stable releases** - More reliable software releases as all changes go through the same verification process before integration.
- **Higher productivity** - Developing and testing in smaller batches raises overall productivity through shorter feedback loops.

### Continuous Delivery Advantages 
Taking CI further into continuous delivery provides additional advantages:
- **Faster time to market** - Changes can be released on demand or automatically once testing passes. This accelerates delivery of new features and bug fixes.
- **Reduced deployment risk** - Strict passing of automated tests before every change makes deployments safer and more predictable.
- **Improvedcollaboration** - All team members benefit from consistent integration and deployment practices that break down silos.
## Installing and Configuring Jenkins
To experience these benefits, you'll need to set up a Jenkins server:
### Downloading Jenkins
Jenkins can run on almost any machine and OS. The easiest way to get started is downloading the Jenkins WAR file and running it directly. Some examples:
- **Windows** - Run the .war file using Java. 
- **Linux** - Use a init script or run as a service. 
- **Docker** - Pull the official Jenkins Docker image.
### Setting Up an Initial Administrator Account 
When Jenkins starts for the first time, it will generate a random admin password for the first admin account. This temporary password can be found in the console output or log files. 
### Configuring Jenkins Plugins
Jenkins has a robust plugin ecosystem for extending its capabilities. Install plugins to support your desired CI/CD tools, build environments and more through the Plugin Manager. Common CI plugins include:
### Configuring Access Control 
Restrict access to Jenkins as needed using built-in roles like administrators, users, etc. You can also integrate Jenkins with external user databases.
### Setting Up a Sample Project 
Create a "Hello World" project to test Jenkins is properly set up. Define things like source code location, build steps, test scripts etc. Trigger the first build to confirm your initial Jenkins configuration works.
This covers the basic steps to download, install and get started with Jenkins on its own. We'll explore Jenkins pipelines and integrating with additional tools like source control systems and deployment targets in future parts.
