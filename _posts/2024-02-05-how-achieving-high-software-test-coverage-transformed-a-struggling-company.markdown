International corporations face immense pressure to continually grow their revenue and market share each quarter. However, when issues emerge like widespread product recalls, it can seem nearly impossible to turn things around. With the right leadership and testing strategy, it's amazing what's possible.
### Embracing Code Coverage Standards 
One of the first steps our hero took was instituting clear code coverage standards for all development teams. He required ***line coverage of at least 60%*** initially, ramping up to ***over 70%***. ***Decision or branch coverage*** also started at 70% and grew beyond 80%. By establishing measurable targets, everyone had the same definition of "good enough" and could track progress over time.

### Ensuring High-Quality Automated Tests
It's not enough to simply hit code coverage benchmarks—the quality of those tests matters greatly. Our expert rolled out training on **BS7925–2 testing best practices** to foster more **targeted, intelligent testing**. Together, metrics like coverage, defects, and code churn provided insights into how effectively teams were verifying their work. 
### Introducing Test Escape Analysis  
Another key innovation was introducing **Test Escape Analysis (TEA)** to systematically review why issues weren't found sooner. TEA provided a faster alternative to traditional root cause analysis (RCA) that often went undone. With TEA, teams could immediately respond to lessons learned from recent defects.
### Leveraging Additional Metrics
To supplement coverage metrics, our hero utilized **Halstead software science metrics** to predict the number and timing of remaining bugs. When automated testing failed to find stragglers, **exploratory testing** using various intelligence-guided techniques found the rest. Relying on multiple quantifiable measures resulted in exceptionally high-quality code.
### Reaping the Rewards of Quality Focus 
The dramatic improvements were clearly paying off—sales increased by nearly $20 million in a single quarter after instituting these practices! Unfortunately, the new owners lacked the same commitment to quality once the software stabilized. Within months, product recalls reemerged without consistent testing standards. Quality demands constant attention and measurement to maintain.
### Invitation to Consult 
For companies struggling with similar issues, our expert remains willing to share his experiences and best practices. By focusing on measurable code coverage, test quality, and continual learning from defects, even the most challenged products and development teams can transform their trajectory. The financial and customer satisfaction returns make a quality mindset well worth the investment.
