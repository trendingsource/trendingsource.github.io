Serverless technologies like AWS Lambda allow developers to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. By using Lambda's serverless functions triggered by events, applications can be built more efficiently and respond to dynamic conditions in a scalable way. However, serverless applications still need services like caching to optimize performance and reduce load on backend databases and APIs. This article will explore how to leverage Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with AWS Lambda functions to build a scalable serverless caching layer.
### **Implementing Serverless Caching with ElastiCache for Memcached** 
Memcached is an open-source in-memory caching system used to speed up dynamic applications by storing frequently accessed data in RAM to reduce database queries. As Lambda functions don't natively support an in-memory caching layer, ElastiCache for Memcached can be used to provide this capability from Lambda functions. ElastiCache is a fully-managed in-memory caching and database service that makes it simple to deploy, operate, and scale an Memcached cluster in the AWS cloud. 
Lambda functions can be configured to connect to an ElastiCache Memcached cluster to cache query results, API responses, or any other computationally expensive data retrievals. For example, a Lambda function that fetches product data from a database on each API request could instead first check the ElastiCache cluster. If the item is present in the cache, it returns that value without querying the database. If a cache miss occurs, the function retrieves the data from the database and stores it in the cache for future requests. This both improves response time by eliminating database calls and reduces load on the backend databases.

### **Benefits of Serverless Caching with ElastiCache**
There are several advantages to using ElastiCache as a serverless caching layer with Lambda functions. First, the fully-managed service takes away the operational overhead of maintaining caching infrastructure. ElastiCache clusters can auto-scale as needed to accommodate varying load levels from Lambda functions. This "serverless caching" matches the scalability and flexibility of serverless compute with Lambda. 
Another benefit is cost-effectiveness - only paying for the cache resources needed rather than pre-provisioning caching servers. Lambda functions scale down to zero when idle, avoiding caching costs when not in use. The pay-as-you-go model of both services keeps costs tightly aligned with actual usage rather than fixed infrastructure costs. 
Caching with ElastiCache also improves responsiveness of serverless applications. By storing pre-computed data in-memory, cache hits allow Lambda functions to return responses much faster without waiting on backend systems. This enhances the user experience of serverless applications facing dynamic workloads and traffic patterns.
### **Implementing a Serverless Caching Layer for API Requests**
As an example of using ElastiCache from Lambda functions, consider a serverless API that retrieves product data from a database. To add a caching layer:
1. Create an ElastiCache Memcached cluster in the same region as the Lambda functions. 
2. In the Lambda function code, add the required **cache npm module** dependencies and credentials for the Memcached cluster. 
3. Modify the function to first check the cache for the requested item key before querying the database. 
4. On a cache hit, return the cached value. On a miss, fetch fresh data from the database and store it in the cache under the item key for subsequent requests. 
5. Set cache expiration times as needed based on data volatility. For example, cache product data for an hour but cache categories indefinitely.
6. As traffic scales up and down, the auto-scaled Memcached cluster will grow and shrink to match the load from caching Lambdas.
By adding this serverless caching layer, the API can now leverage the performance benefits of caching while maintaining the scalability, availability and cost-effectiveness of serverless architectures on AWS.
### **Additional Use Cases for Serverless Caching** 
While caching API responses is a common scenario, there are many other ways serverless caching could be applied. For example, a media transcoding Lambda could cache processed file versions rather than re-encode on each trigger. Or serverless databases like DynamoDB could use caching for query results or to buffer write requests during peak loads.
Caching could also be used for rate limiting APIs or monitoring services. Tracking recent requests in a cache allows enforcing thresholds while avoiding database writes. Caching cross-account permissions lookups avoids continually fetching IAM policies. And caching machine learning inference results enables powering predictive experiences at scale.
In all of these cases, treating caching as another serverless "function" using ElastiCache aligns costs with actual usage, avoids idle infrastructure costs, and offers an autoscaling caching layer purpose-built for dynamic serverless workloads. Combined with Lambda's event-driven model, this serverless caching approach unlocks new deployment patterns and performance optimizations.
### **Conclusion**
AWS Lambda and ElastiCache together present an elegant serverless approach to caching within serverless applications and services. By decoupling caching resources from specific servers or instances, this "functions as caching" model scales inline with demand rather than fixed infrastructure limits. The autoscaling and fully-managed nature of ElastiCache removes caching operations overhead. And using caching from Lambda improves performance by accelerating function response times through cached content retrieval rather than always querying backend sources. Overall, serverless caching provides an optimized, cost-effective method for incorporating caching into serverless architectures on AWS.
