### Getting Started with Dockerfiles
**Dockerfiles** allow you to automate the creation of Docker images for your applications. The Dockerfile defines what goes on in the image including operating system, packages, software dependencies, environment variables, etc. To build an image, you first write a Dockerfile text file containing all your instructions. 
Some key points about Dockerfiles:
- They use a simple instruction format like `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY` to define each step. This makes them portable and easy to understand.
- You specify a `FROM` image to base your image on. For example Ubuntu or Alpine Linux.
- Common instructions include `RUN` to run shell commands, `COPY` to add files, and `EXPOSE` to open ports.
- The Docker daemon builds images automatically by running each instruction in sequence.
- You can build Docker images on any machine with Docker installed, not just your production servers.
So in summary, Dockerfiles automate the process of creating reproducible Docker images for your applications. They ensure your deployment environment is consistent across different machines.

### Optimizing Image Size with Multi-Stage Builds
When building Docker images, it's important to keep the **final image size small** for performance and efficient storage reasons. One best practice is to use Docker's multi-stage builds which allow you to split the build process into multiple stages.
For example, you may have a `build` stage with all your build dependencies and tools. Then a `package` stage which copies just the final packaged artifacts without the dev tools. Finally a `runtime` stage with only what's needed to run the app.
This allows you to install tools needed for building/packaging in one stage, while keeping the final runtime image lean and optimized. So your production images don't include unnecessary files or development packages.
Multi-stage builds improve build performance by caching intermediate images. They create optimized Docker images by including only what's truly needed at runtime versus installing everything upfront.
### Using Volumes for Data Persistence 
When building Docker images, you'll want any **application or user-generated data** to persist even if the container is destroyed and recreated. Docker provides volumes to mount directories from your Docker host or other containers.
Any files mapped to a volume will not be included in the container's writable layer or committed to images. Instead, they reside physically on the host machine or external storage. This has a few advantages:
- Data isn't tied to the lifecycle of containers - it persists even if they are removed. 
- Volumes allow services like databases to have their data storage isolated from the running container instance.
- Multiple containers can mount and share the same volume, allowing for easy data sharing.
Common uses of volumes include persisting databases, log files, uploads/media etc. You map these directories instead of copying the files into the Docker image.
### Exposing Ports and Configuring Networking
When building applications to run in containers, you'll often want to **expose ports so the containers can accept TCP/IP connections**. The `EXPOSE` Dockerfile instruction allows you to define what listening ports are available. 
You also need to configure the container's network so these ports are accessible from linked or external containers, host networks, load balancers etc. By default Docker containers can all communicate through an internal default bridge network.
Some networking options include:
- Configuring ports and networks at runtime with `docker run -p HOSTPORT:CONTAINERPORT`
- Creating user-defined bridged or overlay networks for communication between containers 
- Publishing ports on swarm services for load balancing across replica containers
- Mapping ports to services on host networks so clients access a fixed host port
Proper networking setup ensures your application containers can communicate as needed both internally and externally during deployment.
### Setting Environment Variables
When developing applications for containers, it's usually necessary to externalize **configuration through environment variables** instead of hardcoding values. This makes apps portable across different configurations/deployments.
The `ENV` Dockerfile instruction allows setting environment variables that will be available to the running application. Common uses include database URLs, API keys, credentials, feature flags, logging configs and more.
Some best practices when using environment variables in Dockerfiles:
- Set required environment variables as early as possible 
- Use descriptive names separated by underscores instead of hyphens
- Set reasonable default values where applicable
- Document environment variables and their purpose for others
- Consider storing sensitive values externally instead of Dockerfiles
Setting configuration through environment variables allows containers to run in different environments without code changes. It is a key technique for building portable and configurable Docker applications.
### Deploying Containers with Docker Compose
Once you have built docker images, you need a way to easily deploy and launch multiple related **containers as a single deployable unit**. Docker Compose allows defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
With a `docker-compose.yml` file, you can:
- Define services as containers of a specific image 
- Set which ports to expose and host ports to map them to
- Specify service dependencies so they start/stop in the right order
- Define volumes from files/folders on the local machine to mount  
- Allocate resources like CPUs/memory for resource constrained hosts
- Automate container linking and networking configuration
Docker Compose makes it simple to launch complex applications with a single `docker-compose up -d` command. It handles linking, networking and orchestration for you across a grouping of images and containers.
This is extremely useful for microservices development and deploying full apps made of multiple components. Docker Compose streamlines the deployment of multi-container Docker applications.
### Automating Builds with Docker Hub and GitHub
Once you have Dockerfiles and docker-compose configuration files in source control, the final step is to **automate the build process**. Docker Hub and GitHub container registries allow building docker images automatically on code changes.
Some key capabilities include:
- Automatically build images from Dockerfiles stored in GitHub repos when code is committed
- Trigger "hooks" that rebuild images during code merges to master or tags
- Store built images in private or public repositories on Docker Hub or GitHub Packages  
- Scan images for vulnerabilities during builds before deployments
- Integrate image builds as part of CI/CD pipelines for deployment  
- Enforce code reviews, testing, and approval processes before image publishing
Automating builds ensures each commit results in new docker images. It also performs security scanning without manual steps. Combined with Docker Compose, this allows rebuilding and redeploying apps with a single command when source changes.
So in summary, Docker radically simplifies deploying containerized applications through Dockerfiles, Docker Compose, and integration with repository services for automated builds. These tools allow creating portable application deployment pipelines through containers.
