## What is Continuous Integration?
Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.
CI aims to minimize the integration problems that occur when code commits are infrequent and large batches of code are merged together at the same time. By integrating regularly in small increments, it prevents integration problems and makes them easier to detect, resolve and address in an incremental way.
## What is Jenkins?
**Jenkins** is a **popular open-source automation server** used for continuous integration to monitor and execute automatic builds. It can execute Python, shell scripts, Perl, etc. Jenkins helps developers and operations teams work together efficiently. 
Jenkins supports hundreds of plugins to extend its functionality. It provides continuous integration for any programming language. Some key features of Jenkins include:
### Configurable build triggers
Jenkins allows setting up automated builds that are triggered by events like commits, check-ins etc. This ensures changes are tested quickly.

### Visualize project health
Jenkins provides graphical representations that allow monitoring the health status of jobs, builds, test results etc.
### Distributed builds
It can distribute builds across multiple machines to parallelize and accelerate builds.
## Why Use Jenkins for Continuous Integration and Delivery?
There are several key benefits of using Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery:
### Early bug detection 
Jenkins automates the process of testing code changes and merging them into a main branch. This enables catching bugs early before they become harder and more costly to fix.
### Faster development cycles
Automated build and testing speeds up the development cycle as changes no longer need to wait until end-of-sprint or releases to get tested. Developers get faster feedback.
### Improved code quality
Regular testing uncovers defects early. By fixing them immediately, code quality is improved over time through multiple integration builds each day.
### Reduced risks
Smaller, more frequent code changes mean less code gets merged and deployed at once. This significantly reduces risk of integration failures and deployment issues. 
### Easy rollbacks
If a broken build is deployed, Jenkins makes it simple to roll back to the previous known good version rapidly to minimize downtime and impact.
### Self-documenting builds
Jenkins provides a historical record of all builds, changes, test results etc. This acts as documentation on what code and tested features are included in each version.
## How Jenkins Works for Continuous Integration
Jenkins has a master-slave architecture where a Jenkins master node manages one or more agent/slave nodes. Here is a typical workflow:
### Source code management
Developers commit code changes to a source code management system like Git.
### Trigger build 
When code is committed, Jenkins automatically triggers a build on the master node to compile and run tests. 
### Distribute tasks
The master node distributes build tasks like compilation, testing, packaging etc. across available slave nodes for parallel processing.
### Record results
Test results, logs and artifacts are recorded by Jenkins for each build. Failed builds are flagged and emails/notifications sent.
### Deploy on success
If all stages pass, Jenkins deploy packages/containers to test and production environments via plugins.
This allows catching errors early in an automated, continuous manner vs. infrequent, manual integrations.
## Jenkins Plugins for CI/CD
One of Jenkins' biggest strengths is its vast ecosystem of plugins. Some commonly used plugins include:
### Github Integration
Integrates GitHub repositories for automatic builds when commits are pushed.
### Docker Plugin  
Builds Docker images and containers using Dockerfiles as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
###Artifact Upload
Uploads build artifacts and metadata like test results to cloud storage for sharing/auditing. 
###Deployment Plugin
Deploys build artifacts to test and production environments like Kubernetes or VM servers. 
###E-mail Notification
Sends emails on build failures, successes to notify developers and operations teams.
Plugins extend Jenkins and enable automating practically any workflow from building to deploying cloud-native applications.
In summary, Jenkins is an open source automation server that streamlines continuous integration and delivery. Its vast plugin ecosystem makes Jenkins flexible to build any workflow from simple to complex cloud-native application pipelines.
