Automation testing using Jenkins can put a significant load on the main Jenkins server, especially if running tests that interact with browsers. Here are some effective strategies to distribute the load across multiple systems.
## Running Tests on Remote Systems
One approach is to have Jenkins simply trigger or schedule tests, while having the tests actually execute on remote systems. This removes the test execution workload from Jenkins.
### Cloud Testing Services
Cloud-based testing services like Sauce Labs and BrowserStack allow running tests remotely in their data centers using a global browser grid. Tests execute via a REST API, with results reported back. This removes the need to maintain your own infrastructure.

### Dedicated Test Machines
For internal or privacy reasons, tests can run on dedicated in-house machines configured as Jenkins slaves. Jenkins then distributes tests to these remote "test workers" using plugins like Selenium Grid. Keeping tests separate avoids overloading Jenkins itself.
## Distributed Execution with Browsers Remote 
Even when tests run on Jenkins, browsers consume significant resources. The Selenium WebDriver protocol allows remotely controlling browsers on other machines. Jenkins can run tests locally while sending browser commands to remote systems, distributing the intensive browser usage.
### Setting Up a Selenium Grid 
A Selenium Grid acts as a browser host, allowing tests to launch browsers across a pool of grid nodes. Tests run on Jenkins communicate with the grid over HTTP to distribute browser launching. This model scales very well to consume idle resources.
### Commercial Hosted Testing Solutions
Companies like Sauce Labs and BrowserStack provide managed Selenium grids in their data centers, removing the need to set up and maintain your own infrastructure. Jenkins tests send requests over HTTPS tunnels to the commercial grid.
## Leveraging Jenkins Slaves and Agents
Jenkins has built-in support for running builds and tasks on "slave" or "agent" systems configured from the master. Plugins like Selenium and JUnit allow distributing test execution across Jenkins slaves, dividing the workload.
In summary, there are effective strategies to distribute heavy browser-based testing load away from the main Jenkins server. This includes running tests remotely on dedicated systems, commercial grid services, or Jenkins slaves and agents to optimize resource usage.
## Optimizing Resource Usage of Selenium Tests
Some specific techniques can also optimize how Selenium-driven tests use resources:
### Clean Up Browser Profile Between Tests
Having tests leave browser data like caches and cookies between runs wastes memory. The Selenium WebDriver `Manage().DeleteAllCookies()` and `driver.quit()` methods clear this data.
### Parallelize Test Execution 
Running tests sequentially means browsers are open one at a time. Parallel execution with tools like JUnit Parameterized tests run browsers concurrently, faster completion for the same resource usage. 
### Use Lightweight Browsers for Testing
Browsers consume very different amounts of memory - lighter ones like PhantomJS use fewer resources than Chrome or Firefox for many test cases.
### Cache External Resource Requests
Using services like webservicex.net allow caching web service and API responses to avoid repetitively hitting real endpoints.
In summary, careful test design and tuning can significantly improve how efficiently and economically browser automation testing systems like Jenkins with Selenium are able to handle the associated workload. Distributed execution strategies help maximize available resources as well.
