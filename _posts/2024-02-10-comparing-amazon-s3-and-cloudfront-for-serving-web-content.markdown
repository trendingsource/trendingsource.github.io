## A Reliable, Scalable Storage Service  
Amazon S3 provides highly durable object storage on a massive global scale. As Amazon's original cloud storage service introduced in 2006, S3 has established itself as the industry standard for storing and serving any volume of data. Objects can range in size from 0 bytes up to 5 terabytes each, and there are no pre-set limits on the total amount of data an S3 account can hold.
S3 achieves eleven 9's of durability by storing customer objects across multiple facilities and automatically repairing any lost redundancy. Object versioning and non-expiring lifecycles allow customers to retain unlimited past versions of an object indefinitely. With such strong durability and availability guarantees, S3 is well-suited for storing any dataset that must remain accessible for compliance, archival or disaster recovery purposes.
### Object Access and Distribution 
Objects stored in S3 are private by default, but can be enabled for public access through pre-defined access controls and object permissions. Customers can distribute content publicly using S3 website hosting or **static website hosting** functionality. However, files accessed directly from S3 may experience higher latencies for users located far from S3's regional data centers.

## Accelerated Content Delivery with CloudFront 
CloudFront is Amazon's **content delivery network** (CDN) service that caches content at numerous global edge locations. By storing cached copies of content closer to end users, CloudFront is able to deliver files with much lower latency. It fulfills requests from the nearest edge location whenever possible instead of routing back to the origin storage like S3.
### Caching and Global Distribution
CloudFront caches customer files intelligently based on HTTP headers and access patterns. Objects are automatically cached at edges until they expire based on configurable TTL settings. This caching allows subsequent requests for the same file to be fulfilled locally without accessing the origin. 
With over 200 points of presence worldwide, CloudFront ensures content is geographically distributed to optimize delivery speeds. It integrates seamlessly with AWS services like S3, simplifying global content distribution without having to manage complex caching infrastructures.
### Integrating S3 and CloudFront
The most common use case is to leverage both services together - using S3 as the origin store and CloudFront as the distributed cache. S3 provides economic scalable storage for the definitive versions of files, while CloudFront caches copies closer to users for low latency access. This is an effective architecture for delivering everything from static websites to dynamic web applications on a global scale.
## Reliable Storage and Accelerated Delivery 
With S3 and CloudFront, Amazon provides scalable, geographic-aware infrastructure for reliably hosting any volume of content. S3 focuses on durable object storage at global scale, while CloudFront takes caching and edge acceleration even further through a globally distributed CDN. Using these services together yields the best of both worlds - indefinite storage in S3 with instant access via CloudFront's edge cache worldwide.
For web content in particular, the S3 and CloudFront combination has emerged as the de facto standard. Websites and applications can achieve lightning fast load times by leveraging CloudFront to cache and serve static assets like images, videos, and JavaScript libraries. Dynamic content continues to benefit from S3's virtually unlimited storage capacity and high availability. With strong durability, flexibility, and optimized performance - S3 and CloudFront make an incredibly powerful content hosting platform.
