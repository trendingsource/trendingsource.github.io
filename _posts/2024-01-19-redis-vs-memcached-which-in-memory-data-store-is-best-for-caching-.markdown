### The Basics
Redis and Memcached are both open-source, in-memory data stores designed for caching purposes. Both provide fast access to data held entirely in RAM to speed up applications. However, there are a few key differences in how each one works and the functionality they provide. 
Memcached operates as a simple key-value store where clients make requests through a simple API to retrieve values associated with keys. It is multithreaded to support many concurrent requests and is memory efficient by storing keys and values without additional metadata. 
Redis goes a step beyond key-value with support for data structures like strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets. While still very fast, it is single-threaded and uses more memory overhead to support these additional data types. Redis also optionally persists data to disk so it is not strictly in-memory.

### Persistence and Data Types 
The ability of Redis to persist data to disk is a **major advantage** over the strictly in-memory Memcached. For applications that cache large datasets, not having to fully populate the cache from scratch after a restart is tremendously helpful. Redis can power the "warm up" phase much faster than an empty Memcached cache.
The Redis data structures like hashes and lists open up **new possibilities** for caching that aren't possible with simple string values. For example, storing application sessions as Redis hashes allows direct access to session properties rather than serializing/deserializing entire session strings. Lists also enable caching patterns like leaderboards that aren't a natural fit for Memcached's key-value model.
### Capacity and Concurrency  
In terms of maximum throughput, Memcached has an edge since it is multithreaded whereas Redis is single-threaded. **High-volume situations** with 100s of millions of keys may push the limits of a single Redis instance more than Memcached. 
However, Memcached is more **memory-hungry**. It stores all keys and values together inline so keys must be small. Redis separates keys and values allowing larger, more descriptive keys at the cost of more memory overhead. For applications with tens or hundreds of millions of keys, the memory savings of Memcached could provide a significant cost reduction.
Both Redis and Memcached support horizontal sharding/partitioning to scale across multiple servers. The client libraries handle distributing and retrieving data from the cluster to achieve very high throughput.
### Feature Set Comparison
Beyond core caching capabilities, Redis provides additional features like pub/sub messaging, Lua scripting, and data pipeline functionality. For some applications, access to these extras help justify Redis despite a small performance deficit versus Memcached.
Redis data types provide a richer set of functionality for problems beyond simple key-value like leaderboards, session storage, and pub/sub functionality. It also has modules for additional datatypes like Geo through the RedisGis module. 
Memcached focuses solely on core caching and does so very efficiently. But for applications needing richer data structures or secondary functions like messaging, Redis may be a better overall fit.
### Pricing and Hosting 
When self-hosted, Redis does have a small cost premium due to requiring more storage space for keys and the persistence functionality. However, Redis remains very inexpensive to operate at any scale.
Major cloud providers like AWS offer both Redis and Memcached as fully-managed database services under their Elasticache product name. The pricing for comparable instances on these services is very similar for the two databases. 
The hosted options remove the operational burden of configuration, patching, failover etc. But Redis hosted versions have some limitations on features like persistence and sharding/clustering abilities compared to self-managed installations.
### Choosing the Right Database
For most common caching use cases, both Redis and Memcached will serve the purpose well with Redis offering broader functionality for a small potential performance cost. 
Memcached may be preferable for extremely high-volume workloads with 100s of millions of keys or where strict memory efficiency is critical. 
Redis expands what is possible through data structures, persistence, and extra functions. It is generally the better choice if an application could utilize any of its expanded feature set.
Overall Redis has become the more full-featured option compared to the simpler Memcached for most modern caching and low-latency data storage needs. But Memcached still has its place for ultra high-performance key-value only workloads.
