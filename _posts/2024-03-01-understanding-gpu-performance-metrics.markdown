The advancement of machine learning has accelerated the need for powerful GPUs to handle computationally intensive tasks like training deep neural networks. However, comparing GPU performance can be difficult due to different benchmarks and metrics used by companies. This article seeks to clarify some common terms used to describe GPU performance like TOPS, TFLOPS and how they relate to deep learning applications.  
### What is TOPS and TFLOPS?
TOPS stands for **Tera Operations Per Second** and refers to performing one trillion operations in a single second. Operations can refer to basic math functions like addition and multiplication. However, TOPS is an ambiguous term as it does not specify the data type, such as whether operations are performed on integers, floating points or tensors. 
TFLOPS stands for **Tera Floating-Point Operations Per Second** and more clearly measures one trillion floating-point operations per second. Floating-point refers to numbers with decimal points, like 3.14159. TFLOPS is commonly used to rate the performance of CPUs and GPUs for HPC workloads.

### The Limitations of TOPS and TFLOPS for Deep Learning 
While TOPS and TFLOPS give an indication of computational throughput, they do not capture the full picture needed for deep learning workloads which involve different data types. Modern deep learning models often use lower precision datatypes like half-precision (16-bit) and bfloat16 instead of the usual 32-bit floating point. Processing lower precision data provides a significant performance boost compared to higher precision data. 
Benchmarking solely based on TOPS or TFLOPS also fails to consider how efficiently different hardware architectures can handle the linear algebra primitives common in deep learning like matrix multiplications. For accurate performance comparisons, benchmarks like MLPerf that evaluate on real-world models are better indicators.
### Understanding GPU Performance for Different Data Types
GPUs like NVIDIA's can process operations using various data types from 4-bit up to 64-bit floating point on different cores like Tensor Cores. Generally, lower precision datatypes allow for higher throughput. As a rule of thumb, each halving of bits results in around twice the performance. For example, processing with 16-bit float is around 2x faster than 32-bit float. 
This makes TOPS and TFLOPS even more ambiguous, as they do not specify the bit width used. So while a new GPU may advertise higher TOPS, it may use lower precision that results in less accurate models. Datatype is really what determines deep learning performance.
### Comparing Performance Requires Real Model Benchmarks
Given the limitations of TOPS and FLOPS metrics, the best approach is to look at benchmarks running realistic deep learning models, workloads and datasets. MLPerf is an industry standard benchmark that provides an apples-to-apples comparison of hardware running popular models like BERT, ResNet and object detection.
Benchmarks not only restrict the data types but also control for variables like batch sizes, precision levels, model sizes and more. They give a holistic view of a system's ability to train and infer on models that matter. For accurate performance assessments, real model benchmarks should take priority over broad throughput metrics like TOPS that lack specificity around datatypes and workloads.
In summary, while TOPS and TFLOPS provide a general idea of computational grunt, they fail to convey the full picture of a system's deep learning abilities which depend greatly on supported datatypes and architectures. The best evaluations come from benchmarks running representative models and workloads.
