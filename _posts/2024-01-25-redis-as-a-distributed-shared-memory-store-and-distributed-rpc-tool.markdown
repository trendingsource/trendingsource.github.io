Redis is a versatile in-memory data store that can be used in a variety of interesting ways beyond typical caching. Due to its distributed nature, fast performance, and ability to store complex data structures, Redis is well-suited for implementing distributed shared memory systems and remote procedure calls in a simple yet robust manner. 
### Leveraging Redis Data Types
Redis supports several advanced data types like lists, sets, hashes, and strings that could be used to share state across distributed systems. For example, lists can act as queues for communicating work between processes, while pub/sub allows publishing real-time updates. Hashes are useful for storing complex object data in a natural way. By taking advantage of atomic operations like Lua scripting, entire data models can be replicated consistently across servers.

### Scalable Distributed Shared Memory
Using Redis' data types alongside server-side sharding, a distributed shared memory system could be built to share large amounts of data flexibly across many servers. Entire application domains could be represented as Redis objects residing in memory, with client libraries handling distribution transparently based on the data's hash. This removes the need to shuttle objects between remote procedure calls and can enable loosely-coupled distributed microservices.
### Simple Yet Robust Remote Procedure Calls
Redis lists provide a natural fit for implementing queue-based remote procedure calls. Functions are represented as list keys while their serialized arguments become list elements. Workers empty queues by blocking on list blocking pops and reply by pushing results to return keys. **Robust mechanisms like retries and duplication mitigate partial failures without client impacts.** The pub/sub system can additionally coordinate mass actions across services. Overall Redis RPC remains lightweight while gaining transactional integrity from the server.
### Building on a Solid Foundation 
As a high-performance foundation for sharing state and coordinating distributed systems, Redis strikes an ideal balance of functionality, performance, and language independence. By leveraging Redis' low-latency access to in-memory data structures, entirely new classes of distributed applications can be built without much programming effort. With features like replication, clustering and Lua scripting continually improving, Redis' versatility will only increase over time.
### Event Sourcing Made Simple 
Event sourcing is a pattern for reliably tracking state changes. With Redis streams, an append-only log of events can be distributed across servers while being consumed concurrently. **Using consumer groups, event handlers like microservices can process updates in parallel based on event types.** Comparing stream positions facilitates out-of-order processing and idempotency. Failures are mitigated through automated replays from the append-only log. Overall Redis makes event sourcing an approachable primitive.
### Internet of Things Integration  
As more devices integrate with the Internet, lightweight protocols are needed to coordinate information between them at scale. Redis' pub/sub model is well-suited to treat devices as real-time event publishers. Gateways can subscribe to topics like sensor readings, alerts, or configuration updates. Since devices are distributed and may disconnect, state can be durably cached on Redis, with expirations retaining freshness. Remote procedure calls further enable configuration interactions using queues. Redis' language-agnostic interface facilitates IoT integration using various protocols and formats.
### Configuration as Code Patterns
Infrastructure as code approaches aim to define environments programmatically rather than manually. Using Redis hashes, entire configurations can be versioned, broken into namespaces, and altered transactionally. Services access configurations directly from Redis using watchers for automatic reloads. Since definitions exist as data rather than static files, advanced workflows are possible like generating configurations from templates, schemas, or other services. Redis' data structures thus underpin flexible configuration infrastructure at any scale. 
In conclusion, Redis provides a solid foundation for building distributed systems by enabling shared state, coordination, and remote interactions in a simple, high-performance manner. Its datatypes can underpin entirely new abstractions and patterns in areas like distributed object systems, serverless computing, service meshes and beyond. With Redis as the lingua franca, microservices and distributed applications gain new flexibility to be developed and operate at scale.
