## Creation and Sacrifice
**The Engineers** had a profound role in seeding life across the universe and helping guide early human civilization, as hinted at in the opening scenes and murals within their derelict vessel. We see one Engineer willingly sacrifice himself, drinking from a strange cup that caused disintegration into the basic blocks of all living things. 
This seeding of life through sacrificial creation is a motif hinted at throughout history, from the Sumerian tales of Enki to the Egyptian god Osiris and biblical figure Jesus Christ. It represents a philosophy of creation that demands acceptance of mortality as the means to sustain new life forms. This principle of willing sacrifice seems to have been a core tenet of the Engineers in their stewardship of life.
### Guiding Early Humankind
After creating humanity, the Engineers maintained oversight of our development for hundreds of thousands of years. Primitive artwork depicting their star map hints they invited us to join them once achieving spaceflight. For some time, both races peacefully co-existed with humanity guided by their greater technological prowess and wisdom.

### A Fatal Mistake
Something changed approximately 2,000 years ago that altered this relationship. A monumental human act of violence and rejection of the sacrificial creed so defining the Engineers irrevocably damaged the trust between the two species. Clues suggest this event involved crucifying an Engineer representative on Earth, identified by Ridley Scott as a prototype for the biblical figure of Jesus Christ.
## Contamination and Revenge
The black liquid utilized by the Engineers, shown to model its manifestations based on the intentions of its wielder, was exposed to humanity's newly selfish and violent nature through this act of crucifixion. It corrupted into the first recognizable Xenomorph, with later exposure going on to contaminate the Engineers' homeworld. 
### Wrathful Retribution
Seeking retribution, the Engineers prepared to return to Earth with a doomsday weapon carrying this contagion. Things went awry, and it resulted in the death of the crew and crash on their LV-223 base over 2,000 years ago. The caustic liquid continued decimating the remaining Engineers, leaving behind piles of their corpses. 
### A Warning Unheeded
Humanity's fatal mistake estranged us from our creators. They no longer viewed reformation or redemption possible for our deeply flawed species. When the Prometheus crew arrived on LV-223, they did so unaware of this backstory and the magnitude of the warning left by the dead world and fallen Engineers scattered across it.
## Clash of Philosophies
### A Soulless Representation  
Weyland Corporation's mission was guided not by principles of creation and sacrifice, but ambition and subversion of natural order. When meeting the last surviving Engineer, humanity was represented by the corporeal form of aged CEO Peter Weyland, artificially sustained through technology yet void of spirit, accompanied by his soulless android "son" David.
### Rightful Judgment
Unsurprisingly, the final Engineer expressed outright contempt for the pair. Their wish to leverage his people's secrets for further scientific pursuits, lacking any understanding of the lofty responsibilities that came with such knowledge, marked humans as unworthy in his eyes. Violently ending them was an act of righteous judgment on a failed creation.
### Survival vs. Sacrifice  
The climactic clash came to symbolize the irreconcilable differences in each races' philosophy. Where humanity had come to value survival through any means necessary, even at the cost of others, the Engineers embodied accepting fate and mortality as the sacrifice fueling new life. Their disparate creeds could not co-exist.
## A Cautionary Tale
Viewed as an allegory for humanity's relationship with its past, Prometheus offers a sobering message. Though founded upon noble principles of generous creation and guidance, we risk estranging even the gods through shortsighted acts of violence, greed and rejection of moral obligations. The contaminants we unleash upon the world through such misdeeds may outlive us. Perhaps the only way to find redemption is by returning to our origins of compassion and willing self-oblation.
