## Consider an E-commerce Framework First
For e-commerce sites that need core features like a product catalog, cart, and checkout functionality, it often makes more sense to start with an established open-source framework like **Spree Commerce** rather than building a single-page application from scratch. Spree is a **Ruby on Rails**-based framework that includes all the major components required for an online store right out of the box. 
### Save Time and Effort 
With Spree, you avoid spending countless hours recreating core shopping features and ensuring they work seamlessly together. You can focus instead on customizing the design and adding site-specific functionality. **Spree is also highly configurable** through its extension API, so you have flexibility to modify aspects like tax calculations, shipping methods, and payment processing.

### Easy Frontend Integration
Spree is also backend framework agnostic. It readily integrates with popular frontend frameworks like React and Vue.js through its GraphQL and RESTful APIs. So if you want certain pages rendered as single-page components, that's possible without having to overhaul the entire site's architecture. You get the best of both worlds.
## When a SPA May Make Sense
A single-page application approach could be preferable for simpler sites with limited functionality or very specific needs. For example:
### Minimal Features Needed
If the site only involves a product display page, some basic filters, and a simple checkout flow, rebuilding this as a specialized SPA may be a good use of time and resources compared to configuring a larger e-commerce platform.
### Heavy Interactive Content  
Applications with **immersive shopping experiences**, sophisticated product visualization tools, or live filtering/browsing capabilities may perform better as SPAs that allow heavy client-side interactivity without page reloads.
### Ambitious Custom Requirements
Building highly customized functionality from scratch often requires low-level framework control a SPA provides compared to integrating with an existing platform. Ambitious designs may push existing platforms to their limits.
## Weighing Pros and Cons for Your Site
For most conventional e-commerce sites, leveraging a full-featured platform like Spree offers substantial workload reduction and proven stability compared to writing everything from scratch as a SPA. Consider your specific needs and timeline, then evaluate whether a framework or custom app makes the most sense for your goals and technical capabilities. With careful planning, both options can work.
## In Summary
Unless requirements demand it, starting from an established e-commerce framework avoids unnecessary work and risks. They ease integration of frontend code while fulfilling core shopping needs out of the box. Evaluate your project specifics â€“ simpler sites or innovative designs may favor custom SPAs if resources allow reinventing the wheel. For most, a framework provides a solid ready-made foundation.
