Enterprise IT teams are facing increasing pressure to deliver applications faster while maintaining security and compliance. Containerization and orchestration with Kubernetes has emerged as a solution, but bringing new technologies into large organizations presents challenges. Two players, Red Hat OpenShift and VMware Tanzu, are well positioned to help enterprises adopt Kubernetes at scale due to their existing customer relationships and product features.
### Leveraging Existing Infrastructure 
Kubernetes was originally developed at Google to manage their internal infrastructure, known as **Borg container cluster management system**. Its main purpose is to efficiently run applications across existing hardware resources. In large enterprises, being able to **maximize resource utilization of on-premises servers and virtual machines** is critical. Both Red Hat OpenShift and VMware Tanzu allow organizations to run Kubernetes on their existing virtualized environments and bare metal servers without needing to overhaul their infrastructure. This minimizes disruption and costs for enterprises.

### Streamlining Compliance and Approvals
Bringing new technologies into large enterprise means going through rigorous review processes to ensure **security, compliance with regulations, and compatibility with other systems**. Red Hat OpenShift and VMware Tanzu have an advantage here since they build Kubernetes as an extension of existing and approved products. Red Hat runs on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, while VMware Tanzu runs on VMware vSphere. If an organization already uses RHEL or vSphere, then OpenShift or Tanzu can be enabled with fewer approvals compared to a stand-alone Kubernetes deployment. This significantly reduces the barriers for enterprise adoption. 
### Automation and Managed Operations
Once approved, ongoing management and operations of Kubernetes clusters present an ongoing challenge for enterprises. This is where Red Hat OpenShift and VMware Tanzu's managed services provide value. Both platforms automate much of the provisioning, patching, backing up and resource monitoring of clusters. Enterprises can focus on their applications rather than spending cycles on infrastructure tasks. Additionally, **24/7 support for production Kubernetes management** reduces operational risks for mission critical workloads. The automation and managed services make the learning curve more gentle for organizations.
### Targeted Use Cases
While Kubernetes can run any workload, Red Hat OpenShift and VMware Tanzu focus on the typical **application modernization, CI/CD automation and microservices architectures** that modern enterprises are adopting. Containers allow splitting monolithic apps into independent services, with Kubernetes orchestrating them. Both platforms provide developer tooling to simplify containerizing and deploying applications at scale on Kubernetes. They also handle **stateful application workloads like databases** that have specific requirements. This targeting of common enterprise use cases makes OpenShift and Tanzu solutions well suited for production deployments.
### Embracing Hybrid Environments
Most enterprises operate in a hybrid model, with some workloads running in public clouds and others remaining on-premises. Red Hat OpenShift and VMware Tanzu support running consistent Kubernetes clusters seamlessly **across on-premises data centers and major public clouds like AWS, Azure, GCP**. Applications can be developed once and deployed anywhere without re-architecting. Enterprises benefit from portability between environments as their infrastructure needs change over time. This hybrid capability is crucial for multi-cloud enterprises evaluating Kubernetes platforms.
### Commitment to Open Standards  
While proprietary vendor extensions exist, Kubernetes and container technologies are based on open standards developed under the CNCF. This encourages interoperability between implementations from different vendors. Red Hat and VMware have both demonstrated long-term **commitments to upstream Kubernetes community** through contributions. Enterprises benefit from this open governance model as it ensures longevity of the platform and prevents vendor lock-in. Standard APIs and formats also make it easier for organizations to change vendors down the road or support multiple options simultaneously for different workloads.
### Comprehensive Platforms for Digital Transformation
Beyond containers and Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift and VMware Tanzu integrate additional modern application services needed for digital transformation initiatives. These include **features for AI/ML workflows, service mesh, security, multi-cloud governance** and more. Enterprises no longer have to stitch together separate point solutions. As their application and infrastructure modernization journeys progress in complexity, they have predictable evolution paths with Red Hat and VMware's full-stack platform approach. Comprehensive capabilities also attract developers and DevOps teams accustomed to standardized stacks.
In summary, Red Hat OpenShift and VMware Tanzu have distinct advantages for enterprises evaluating Kubernetes due to their existing customer relationships built over decades, focus on production-hardened features, and support for consistent environments spanning on-premises data centers and public clouds. Their managed operations and tooling simplify adoption and maximize value from existing infrastructure. As Kubernetes becomes entrenched for application modernization, these two vendors are well positioned to capture many enterprise workloads at large scale.
