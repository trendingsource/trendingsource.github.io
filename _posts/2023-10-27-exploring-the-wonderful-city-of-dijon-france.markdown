## Getting to Know Dijon's Rich History and Culture
Dijon has a long and storied history as the former capital of the powerful Duchy of Burgundy. As such, the city boasts an impressive collection of historical sites that reflect its past grandeur and importance. Make sure to take some time to wander through the Old City Center (le Vieux Dijon) to get a sense of the medieval atmosphere. Stroll down the narrow cobbled streets like [Rue de la Boucherie](https://thetopnews.github.io/the-journey-of-improving-your-drawing-skills/), one of the oldest in the city, and peek inside the half-timbered houses dating back centuries. You'll also find appealing shops and cafes amidst the historic setting. 
Another must-see is the iconic Notre-Dame Church, located right in the heart of the city. Its strikingly unusual **façade covered with 51 unique gargoyles** is truly a sight to behold. According to local superstition, touching the small worn owl carving on the side of the church brings good luck - be sure to rub its head for prosperity. The interior of the church is also beautifully decorated and worth exploring. Make a trip to the surrounding Jardin de l'Évêché public gardens for some greenery and tranquility after taking in the architectural marvels.
### Discovering Dijon's Wine Heritage and Culture
Of course, no visit to Dijon is complete without delving into the region's renowned wine industry. Less than an hour's drive from the city leads you to the famed **route des grands crus**, a 60km stretch through the finest Burgundy vineyards. Be sure to book tastings and tours at prestigious domaines like Château Clos de Vougeot to experience Burgundian Pinot Noir and Chardonnay at their best. Back in Dijon, beer and wine enthusiasts will find themselves in heaven browsing the selection at Marché de Beaune, one of the best wine merchants in Europe. Foodies should also check out Les Halles market for local produce and delicacies.
