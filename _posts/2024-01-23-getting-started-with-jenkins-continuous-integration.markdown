Jenkins is one of the most popular open source tools for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). With its easy to use interface and wide range of available plugins, it allows teams of all sizes to automate builds, tests, and deployments. This guide will walk through the basics of setting up and using Jenkins for automated testing and continuous integration of your projects.
### What is Continuous Integration?
Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers regularly merge code into a central repository, which then triggers an automated build and test of the code. This helps avoid issues that can occur when code is integrated less frequently, and makes it easier for teams to identify problems early in the development process. With CI, teams receive feedback on each change so that if a bug is introduced, it can be found and fixed quickly.

### Installing Jenkins
Jenkins runs as a service on your local machine or server. It can be installed on Windows, Linux, macOS, or Docker. Let's look at some common installation options:
- **Linux/macOS (native):** Download and unzip the latest stable Jenkins WAR file, then run it with Java. 
- **Windows:** Install via an EXE file or zip similar to Linux.
- **Docker:** Pull the Jenkins Docker image - easy to run on any platform with Docker installed.
Once installed, access Jenkins at http://localhost:8080 or the server IP address and port to configure your first project.
### Configuring and Creating Jobs
When Jenkins starts, it will guide you through an initial setup wizard. Here you can create an admin user, install plugins, and connect to source control systems. 
To set up continuous integration, create a new **Freestyle project** that represents your code repository. Configure the project to periodically **poll the source control** for new commits. Then add build steps like **compiling code**, **running tests**, and more. 
You can also use the **pipeline syntax** for more advanced automation with stages, parallelism and post actions. Define the build logic in a Jenkinsfile checked into source control for easy configuration versioning.
### Monitoring Builds and Notifications
After setting up a project, Jenkins will automatically run builds based on the configured schedule. You can monitor builds on the project dashboard, which shows status, duration and test results.
For broken builds, Jenkins supports various **notification methods**. These include email, Slack/HipChat integration, and build badges. Notifications ensure your team is promptly alerted about failures so issues can quickly be investigated and fixed.
Over time Jenkins collects build history that can provide useful insights into code quality and the impact of changes. With CI in place, developers have rapid feedback on changes and confidence their code works as expected before pushing to production.
### Using Plugins for Additional Functionality
Jenkins has a large plugin ecosystem that extends its capabilities. Common plugins add features such as running builds on remote agents, deploying to environments, metrics collection, security scans and more. Plugins are easily installed within Jenkins and managed via the web interface.
Some notable plugins to consider include:
- **GitHub/GitLab Plugin** - Integrate source control repositories 
- **PostBuildScript** - Execute scripts after the build 
- **Email Extension** - Configure build notifications
- **Docker Plugin** - Build docker images
- **Deployment Plugin** - Automate deployments
Testing new plugins is safe - they can be temporarily enabled without permanently affecting the system. Plugins unlock many possibilities for continuous integration and delivery workflows.
The powerful combination of open source Jenkins and plugins enables organizations to continuously build, test and deliver high quality software. With a bit of configuration, Jenkins provides an easy way to set up continuous integration for any development project.
