### Why I Still Play My Vita Every Day 
For years now, the PS Vita has been my faithful gaming companion. As a stay-at-home parent, I don't always have access to the main TV, so the portable nature of the Vita has become essential. **With young kids at home, portable gaming allows me some precious moments of solo playtime, whether that's in waiting rooms or simply relaxing in another room.** Its dual analog sticks and robust library of great games have provided endless entertainment, even long after its release from retail stores. At this point, I've built up such a massive backlog of titles on the system that I know I have gaming content to keep me occupied for years to come.

### The Vita's Huge Library of Quality Games
One of my favorite things about the Vita is its enormous selection of **JRPGs, action games, indies, and PSOne classics**. I've sunk countless hours into memorable adventures like **Persona 4 Golden**, **Tales of Hearts R,** and the entire **Hyperdimension Neptunia** series. Action packed brawlers like **Dragon's Crown** and **Rayman Legends** provide frantic fun on the go as well. **Spelunky, Steamworld Dig,** and **The Binding of Isaac** showcase the excellent indie support. And retro classics like **Final Fantasy, Wild Arms,** and **Grandia** let me revisit nostalgic RPGs. With such a deep backlog, I'm never at a loss for what to play next.
### Remaining Durable After Daily Use For Years
Considering all the daily wear and tear it has endured over the past five-plus years, I'm continually amazed at how well my Vita has held up. The buttons feel as responsive as the day I took it out of the box. The rechargeable battery easily provides 5 or more hours of gameplay on a single charge, which allows me to fully drain it each day before recharging overnight with no issues. Countless drops, bumps, and scratches haven't slowed it down either - it simply keeps chugging along, refusing to give up the ghost. While Sony may have moved on, this tough-as-nails handheld shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.
### Remote Play Revolutionized My PS4 Gaming Experience 
One of the Vita's best features has been its remote play functionality with the PlayStation 4. Being able to seamlessly continue my PS4 sessions on the portable Vita is incredible. No longer do gaming interruptions occur if someone else wants to use the living room TV. I've lost count of how many times remote play has saved me from getting roped into rewatching movies and shows with the kids. It turned the Vita into an essential companion for my PlayStation gaming.
### My Hack to Use DualShock 4 Controllers
While the Vita's controls serve it well for many games, some genres like shooters are better suited to a traditional controller. Thanks to remote play, I was able to come up with a workaround that lets me use my DualShock 4 wirelessly with the Vita. Though it involved some tedious initial setup, being able to comfortably play shooter and action games with a proper controller made it well worth the effort. It's a shame Sony never added official DualShock 4 support themselves.
### Discovering New Treasures in my Ever-Growing Backlog
These days, with most new releases supporting PlayStation 4 and newer platforms, the well of Vita releases has dried up. However, that doesn't mean I'm running out of games to play anytime soon. My collection continues growing thanks to PlayStation store sales and I still have dozens of gems in my backlog just waiting to be discovered. Regularly achieving trophies and randomly revisiting old favorites keeps me consistently entertained. As long as this hardy handheld keeps functioning, I have gaming content to last for years more.
### My Ongoing Love Affair Shows No Signs of Fizzling Out 
Looking back, it's been such a joy to have the PS Vita by my side for all these years of gaming. While I don't play it quite as intensely as in years past now that remote play allows including the PS4 on my phone instead, it remains a trusted companion. The RPGs and indies that made it such a powerful system for that genre live on in my regular rotation. Its battery life and durability have exceeded all expectations, surviving constant real-world abuse that would destroy less resilient devices. As much as any love affair can last, my bond with the plucky underdog Vita shows no signs of fading anytime soon. It continues earning its place alongside me with each gaming session, a machine that simply refuses to die.
