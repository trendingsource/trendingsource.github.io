Whether you're looking to start streaming your console or PC games, or enhance an existing stream, a capture card is an essential investment. However, with various options on the market, it can be difficult to determine which card is best suited for your needs and budget. In this guide, we'll compare two popular external capture cards - the Elgato HD60 S and Razer Ripsaw - to help you choose the right one.
### Understand the Key Specifications 
Both the Elgato HD60 S and Razer Ripsaw capture cards support recording and streaming up to 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second. **However, there are some notable differences in their system requirements and additional features.**
The Elgato HD60 S requires a computer with at least a 4th generation Intel Core i5 or AMD equivalent processor, 4GB of RAM, and the Windows 10 operating system. On the other hand, the Razer Ripsaw has slightly less stringent system requirements and is also compatible with Windows 7 and 8. 
In terms of additional capabilities, the Ripsaw includes **two 3.5mm audio ports for capturing microphone and headset audio separately in addition to HDMI pass-through.** Meanwhile, the Elgato offers simpler HDMI input and output only. Both cards are plug-and-play with no additional software needed once installed.

### Review Past Experience with Elgato Capture Cards
I've personally used an older Elgato capture card over six years ago for streaming **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 on Xbox 360**. Despite the outdated hardware by today's standards, the Elgato performed reliably in capturing my gameplay footage with no issues. 
However, initial setup and configuration was more complex than it needs to be. I found the install process unintuitive and needed to reference online guides multiple times to get everything working properly. Elgato has since improved their software, but those early experiences gave me pause.
### Consider Brand Loyalty for Razer Fans 
As a leading PC gaming peripherals brand, Razer understands the needs of gamers. For die-hard Razer fans invested in their ecosystem, the Ripsaw could be an easy choice simply due to brand affinity. 
While it comes with a noticeable price premium over Elgato, **some may find the Ripsaw's seamless integration with other Razer gear to be worthwhile**. Its pairing with Chroma RGB lighting synced devices and software could provide an enhanced streaming experience worthy of the additional cost.
### Evaluate Budget and Primary Needs
For many streamers, budget will be the top deciding factor. In this regard, the Elgato HD60 S has a clear advantage with a retail price nearly $100 less than the Razer Ripsaw. 
Its reliable performance capturing 1080p60 gameplay has earned Elgato recognition as one of the best value capture cards available. While the Ripsaw offers perks like separate audio inputs, those extra features come at a higher price without necessarily improving core recording quality. 
If your primary concern is affordability, the Elgato HD60 S remains an excellent budget-friendly choice that gets the job done without frills. However, those wanting integrated solutions within the Razer ecosystem may find better value in the Ripsaw in the long run.
### Consider System Performance Needs 
At their base level capabilities, both the Elgato and Razer capture cards can effectively record gameplay footage up to 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second with no issues. However, your PC's processing power is critical to ensuring smooth streaming performance without lag or dropped frames.
Modern games are demanding and encoding video while playing puts additional strain on system resources. Most experts recommend dedicating a standalone gaming PC rather than attempting to stream from a laptop. The processor should have at least **four physical cores with a minimum 2.4GHz clock speed** for best results. 
Eight gigabytes of RAM is also an ideal minimum for multitasking between gaming, recording, and running streaming software simultaneously. Meeting these specifications will give you sufficient overhead to produce high quality streams without compromising the gaming experience.
### Build a Budget-Friendly Streaming PC
For those without a dedicated gaming rig, building a basic custom streaming PC can provide the needed muscle on a relatively tight budget. A mini-ITX form factor build focusing on core components can be completed for around $600.
Some key part recommendations include an AMD Ryzen 5 1600 processor with six physical cores, budget-friendly B450 motherboard, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 500GB SSD, and a small Mini-ITX case like the Cooler Master Elite 130. This provides more than enough processing power to run games alongside recording and streaming workflows.
By prioritizing processor and RAM resources over expensive graphics, a compact streaming build at this price point hits the minimum specs needed for capturing console or less demanding PC games. Its smaller footprint also allows for transporting to LAN parties or other local stream venues.
### Compare Elgato and Razer Audio Features 
Both the Elgato HD60 S and Razer Ripsaw can output game and desktop audio directly to streams and recordings. However, the Ripsaw offers an advantage with its dual 3.5mm audio inputs for separating microphone and headset audio sources. 
This allows content creators to cleanly record their voice commentary on a separate track from game audio being output through headphones or speakers. The ability to adjust levels and balance both audio sources independently in software maximizes audio quality and control.
In contrast, the Elgato relies on a single HDMI audio output. While it supports audio pass-through to still hear games, any external microphone would be combined into the same track as the gameplay sound. Post-production separation of the audio becomes necessary instead of handling it natively.
For streamers investing in higher-end XLR microphones or serious podcast/voiceover work, the Ripsaw's dual audio inputs open more creative possibilities. Its features arguably offer better value for professional video producers over the Elgato.
### Choose the Right Capture Card Based on Your Needs
Ultimately, the right capture card depends on an individual's unique setup, priorities, and budget. Key factors to weigh include:
- **Budget:** Elgato HD60 S is more affordable at $159, Ripsaw costs $249.
- **System Specs:** Elgato has lower requirements, Ripsaw supports older hardware.  
- **Streaming Goals:** Ripsaw better for pros, Elgato good for starting budget streams.
- **Audio Quality:** Ripsaw separates mic/audio, Elgato combines into one track.
- **Brand Preference:** Ripsaw integrates better with Razer gear.
For most content creators just getting started on a tight budget, the Elgato HD60 S remains the top recommendation due to its reliable performance and value. But those with means will find the Razer Ripsaw offers enhanced features better suited for high-quality streams. Consider your specific needs above all else to choose between these capable capture cards.
