### What is Pentile Display Technology?  
Pentile displays differ from traditional RGB stripe displays in that they use a pattern of subpixels with **fewer overall subpixels** to achieve **lower production costs** while still providing ** longevity**. However, this can result in **lower effective screen resolution** and certain visual artifacts being more **noticeable** compared to RGB stripe displays. 
### Macro Analysis Reveals the Switch OLED Employs Traditional RGB Stripe Technology
Through macro photography of the Switch OLED screen at high magnification, distinct red, green and blue subpixels in the familiar **RGB stripe arrangement** could be seen. This **confirmed** that each pixel contains **dedicated red, green and blue light-emitting elements** rather than shared subpixels as in Pentile designs.
### Comparisons to Other High-End Mobile Display Technologies
The PlayStation Vita, released over a decade ago, was one of the earliest mobile devices to use OLED with an RGB stripe configuration. However, the **limited screen sizes** available for OLED screens left some uncertainty if Nintendo would adopt this **higher-end technology**. Fortunatley, the quality of the Switch OLED screen **reassured** players it would not be an **issue**.
### Additional Minor Hardware Upgrades of the Switch OLED Model  
In addition to the larger 7-inch OLED display with an **adjustable kickstand**, the Switch OLED dock was upgraded with a **wired Ethernet port** for more **stable online multiplayer** and **double** the **internal storage** at 64GB. The **enhanced audio** was also improved to provide more **immersive gameplay**.
### Why Nintendo Released the Switch OLED Model Now
The benefits of OLED technology for **vivid colors**, **deeper blacks**, **improved power efficiency** and **faster response times** were tailor-made for handheld gaming. Gameplay footage shown in the announcement trailer clearly illustrated the **visual improvement** players could expect when undocked.
### Comparison of Visual Quality in Handheld and Docked Modes  
While the upgraded OLED screen enhances the appearance of games significantly when playing in portable mode, the **hardware and software limitations** remain unchanged when docked to a TV. As such, the visual fidelity delivered to bigger screens is **unchanged** from the original Switch model.
### Upgrading for Visuals Alone May Not Justify the Increased Price
With nearly identical **internal components** as the launch Switch from early 2017, some questioned if the **limited upgrades** were enough to spend more money on a new system, especially for players **primarily using it docked** to their TVs. The original model is still **perfectly capable** after nearly 5 years. 
### Predicting the Future of the Switch Platform
Based on Nintendo's history with other systems like the 3DS, the **lifespan of their platforms** is typically around the **5-6 year mark** before being replaced by an entirely **new generation**. While an upgraded "Switch Pro" could come first, most analysts believe the next iteration after the Switch OLED will be true successor beyond just matching current **HD gaming standards**.
