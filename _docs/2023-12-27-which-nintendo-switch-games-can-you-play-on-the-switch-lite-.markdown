### Most Switch Games Are Playable on the Switch Lite
The Nintendo Switch Lite has opened up portable Nintendo Switch gameplay to an even wider audience. While the Switch Lite trades docking station and detachable controllers for a smaller, handheld-only form factor, it can play nearly all the greatest Switch titles. Here's a comprehensive look at which Switch games work on the Switch Lite and the few exceptions where additional accessories are required.

### Games Requiring Separate Joy-Cons
A small number of Switch games incorporate mechanics that require detached **Joy-Con controllers** in specific scenarios. **Ring Fit Adventure**, Nintendo's exercise RPG, is one such title. Its rhythm gameplay and resistence exercises make use of the IR Motion Camera and leg strap accessory mounted to one Joy-Con. While you can play handheld mode with the included strap, docking allows for a more immersive workout experience.
### Games with Docked Portions 
A handful of multiplayer-focused games have certain modes or mini-games that are **docked-only experiences**. As an example, the menu screens and various party games in **Super Mario Party** are best enjoyed with multiple systems hooked up to the TV. While the core board game modes work handheld, the full party experience demands docking. Other selections in popular Nintendo party compilations fall into this niche as well.
### Titles Made for Detachable Local Multiplayer
Some of the most engaging local multiplayer games on Switch were built around detachable Joy-Con usage. Games such as **1-2-Switch**, with its array of brief minigames, and **Snipperclips**, with its cooperative puzzling, shine best with multiple Joy-Con controllers detached and shared between players. While the core experiences can be played solo in handheld mode, these thrive as social in-person party games.
### Cases Incompatible with Switch Lite Design
A select few Switch titles are simply not compatible with the Switch Lite due to their hardware-integrated designs. Titles from Nintendo's **Labo** series make creative cardboard constructions requiring specific docked setups and Joy-Con features impossible on the handheld-only system. These represent some of the only games one cannot play at all on the Switch Lite.
### Vast Library Fully Compatible for Portable Play
Luckily for Switch Lite owners, the vast majority of games release on the Switch are **fully playable in handheld mode** without issue. This covers blockbuster franchises like The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario, and Pok√©mon as well as virtually every third-party title. Whether you enjoy story-driven adventures, online shooters, or indie gems, these widely varied games transfer seamlessly to the portable experience.
### Summary of Compatible Game Types
In summary, any Switch game that does not integrate **docked functionality, detachable Joy-Con features, or local multiplayer mechanics** will work perfectly on the Switch Lite. This leaves **single-player focused games, online/co-op multiplayer games, and handheld-mode only selections** as recommended options for those primarily gaming on the go with Nintendo's new portable system.
### Optional Accessories for Rare Exceptions
While an immense library awaits, there are a few outliers requiring Joy-Con controllers or further accessories. Nintendo includes a basic carabiner-attached grip to house the detachable Joy-Cons for **Ring Fit Adventure**, but budgeting an additional $30-40 for a second set gives options for very occasional use cases. For most, these exceptions represent minor costs relative to a massive Handheld catalogue. 
### Switch Lite: A Portable Passport to Nintendo's Library
With its lightweight, compact form factor, the Switch Lite is poised to be the go-to portable gateway to Nintendo games on the move. While detached Joy-Cons offer greater flexibility, their few necessary use cases represent a tiny fraction of the overall library. Gamers can feel confident that whichever colorful Nintendo worlds appeal most will be fully accessible experiences with the system's handheld focus at the fore. Its vast selection makes the Switch Lite a must-have for any player primarily gaming outside the home.
